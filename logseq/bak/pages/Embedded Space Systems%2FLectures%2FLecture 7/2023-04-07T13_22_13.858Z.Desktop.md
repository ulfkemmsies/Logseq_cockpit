- Space Radiation Environment and Effects on Embedded Systems
	- Ionizing and non-ionising
		- EM radiation becomes ionizing at around 10 eV
		- EM radiation becomes ionizing between 10e15 and 10e16 Hz (between visible and ultraviolet radiation)
	- Interaction of radiation with matter
		- Ionizing radiation is composed of various forms of energetic particles and waves that are capable of dislodging electrons from atoms and molecules, thereby  altering the structure and properties of matter.
		- There are three major types of ionizing radiation: alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays (or photons).
			- Alpha particles are effectively helium nuclei, consisting of two protons and two neutrons, and carrying a positive charge of +2. They are relatively large and slow-moving compared to other ionizing particles, and can be stopped by simple barriers such as paper or skin. However, when they collide with atoms or molecules, they can cause significant damage, especially if they are emitted from heavy isotopes with sufficient energy.
			- Beta particles are electrons or positrons that are emitted from the nucleus during radioactive decay. They carry a negative or positive charge of -1 or +1, respectively, and are generally more energetic and faster-moving than alpha particles. Beta particles can penetrate deeper into matter than alpha particles, but can still be stopped by denser materials like plastic or aluminum.
			- Gamma rays, also known as photons, are high-energy electromagnetic waves that have no mass or charge. They are emitted during nuclear decay or other radioactive processes, and can travel long distances through matter and air. Gamma radiation is highly ionizing, but since it is not composed of particles, it interacts differently with matter than alpha or beta radiation. Instead of directly interacting with atoms, gamma rays are absorbed through a process called Compton scattering, in which they collide with electrons and transfer some of their energy, causing the electrons to become ionized.
		- The interactions between ionizing radiation and matter depend on several factors, including the type and energy of the radiation, the density and composition of the material, and the duration and intensity of exposure. In general, dense materials with high atomic numbers are more effective at stopping ionizing radiation than lighter or less dense materials. However, some types of radiation can still penetrate deeply into matter or cause significant secondary ionization, which can lead to harmful biological effects.

	- Radiation environment in space
		- Three main sources of radiation in space:
			- Trapped particles
				- **Charged particles motion in the Earth magnetic field**
				  The Earth's magnetic field lines trap both protons and electrons (in opposing directions) in a helical movement along the lines. These charged particles originate from sources such as the solar wind, cosmic rays, and the Earth's ionosphere. 
				  Their motion is primarily governed by the Lorentz force, which is the force exerted on charged particles by electric and magnetic fields. When these charged particles encounter the Earth's magnetic field, they interact in a way that causes them to follow a spiraling path along the field lines. This trapping of charged particles is an important aspect of the Earth's magnetosphere, as it helps protect the planet from harmful solar and cosmic radiation.
				- **Van Allen radiation belts**
				  The radiation belts are layers around a planet, trapped by its magnetic field.
				  Earth has 2 belts discovered by Van Allen in 1958.
				  The outer belt consists mainly of high energy (0.1\(10 \mathrm{MeV}\) ) electrons.
				  Altitude: \(13000-60000 \mathrm{~km}\left(3-10\right.\) Earth radii \(\left(R_E\right)\) )
				  Highest intensity: \(\sim 4-5 R_E\).
				  The inner belt consist mainly of high energy protons.
				  Altitude: 1000-6000 km (0.2 to 2 Earth radii \(\left(R_E\right)\) )
				- **South Atlantic Anomaly**
				  The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is an area where the Earth's inner Van Allen belt comes closest to the Earth's surface, as low as 200 km.
				  It is due to the fact that the Earth's magnetic field is not perfectly aligned with its geographic center and poles (offset tilted and distorted dipole). Over SSA the Earth's magnetic field is weakest.

			- **Radiation induced charging of gate oxide in N-Channel MOSFET**
			  Radiation induced charging of the gate oxide in N-Channel MOSFETs occurs when ionizing radiation creates electron-hole pairs within the oxide layer. The holes are trapped at the oxide-silicon interface, while the electrons move towards the gate electrode. As the electrons accumulate at the gate, the threshold voltage of the MOSFET decreases, causing an unwanted change in the device's electrical characteristics. This effect is known as radiation-induced threshold voltage shift.

			- Radiation can have significant effects on bipolar devices, similar to MOS devices. These effects are mainly due to charge trapping and interface states. The parameter used to describe the amplification of bipolar devices, β or hFE, can degrade due to radiation, ultimately leading to a reduction in gain. The increase in ionizing radiation can lead to an increase in the base current, I_B. Additionally, radiation can also cause leakage in the device. Therefore, it is important to consider radiation effects when designing circuits that are intended to operate in radiation-prone environments, such as satellites or nuclear power plants.

				  Not destructive, but the technology scaling causes the combinatorial circuit to be more sensitive to transient pulses. The width of the SET is one of the main factors that determine whether an SET will result in an upset (fault) or not.
