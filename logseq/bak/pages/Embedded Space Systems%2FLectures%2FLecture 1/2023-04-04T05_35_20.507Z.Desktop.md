- **Benefits of Embedded Systems**
  Greater performance and efficiency: being specialized in one task means a minimization of resources (power, size/mass, data memory utilization, code-size, run-time) while maximizing the performances on that specific task
  Lower cost
  More features: many not possible or practical with other approaches
  Better dependability: the knowledge of the expected behavior and the physical environment at design time can be used to achieve higher predictability and reliability
- **Dependability**
  The extent to which the fulfillment of a required function can be justifiably trusted
  Consists of reliability, availability, and maintainability
- **Reliability**
  The ability of an item to perform a required function under given conditions for a given time interval
- **Availability**
  Ability of an item to be in a state to perform a required function under given conditions at a given instant of time or over a given time interval, assuming that the required external resources are provided
- **Maintainability**
  Ease of performing maintenance on a product

- ## Microcontroller vs Microprocessor
  **Microprocessor (uP)**
  Computing power for general purpose applications
  IC with only CPU, it requires external RAM, ROM, I/O and other peripherals to be operated.
  Microprocessors are generally used for unspecific tasks(no input/output relationship defined).
  The clock speed of the Microprocessor is quite high
  
  **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**
  Simplified definition: MCU= CPU + peripherals
  MCUs are designed to perform specific tasks Since the applications are very specific, they need small resources like RAM, ROM, I/O ports, etc. which can be embedded on a single chip. Specific means applications where the relationship of input and output is defined.
  Depending on the input, some processing needs to be done and output is delivered.
  The use of the microcontroller requires to develop ad-hoc software code.
	- Microprocessor usecases: developing software, games, websites, photo editing, creating documents etc. 
	  MCU Examples: keyboards, mouse, washing machine, digicam, pendrive, remote, microwave, cars, bikes, telephone, mobiles, watches

- **Processor - Memory Gap**
  There is a limit on performance due to the fact that access to external memory is becoming slower.
- **Memory Trade-Offs**
  Large (dense) memories are slow
  Fast memories are small, expensive and consume high power
  Goal: give the processor a feeling that it has a memory which is large (dense), fast, consumes low power, and cheap
  Solution: a Hierarchy of memories

- **Sum of main microcontroller advantages**
  The size of a circuit can be reduced significantly: one microcontroller can replace several other ICs.
  Allows greater flexibility: it can be reprogrammed to change its function.
  It is generally faster than a general purpose processor for its specific function, thanks to access to local, embedded memory and peripherals.
  It requires less software to be written, which means less software to be tested.
  Low design and unit cost.
