	- **Benefits of Embedded Systems**
	  Greater performance and efficiency: being specialized in one task means a minimization of resources (power, size/mass, data memory utilization, code-size, run-time) while maximizing the performances on that specific task
	  Lower cost
	  More features: many not possible or practical with other approaches
	  Better dependability: the knowledge of the expected behavior and the physical environment at design time can be used to achieve higher predictability and reliability
	- **Dependability**
	  The extent to which the fulfillment of a required function can be justifiably trusted
	  Consists of reliability, availability, and maintainability
	- **Reliability**
	  The ability of an item to perform a required function under given conditions for a given time interval
	- **Availability**
	  Ability of an item to be in a state to perform a required function under given conditions at a given instant of time or over a given time interval, assuming that the required external resources are provided
	- **Maintainability**
	  Ease of performing maintenance on a product
