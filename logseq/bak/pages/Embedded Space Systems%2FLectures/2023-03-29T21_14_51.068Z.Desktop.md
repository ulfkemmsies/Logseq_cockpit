	- Concurrency
		- In computer science, concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other.
		- A process is a unit of execution in concurrent programming.
		- Thread is an execution unit that is part of a process. A process can have multiple threads.
		- Multithreading is a technique which allows a CPU to execute many tasks of one process at the same time. These threads can execute individually while sharing their resources.

		- Microcontroller Unit HW & SW for Concurrency
			- CPU executes instructions from one or more thread of execution
			- Hardware peripherals add dedicated concurrent processing, some examples being
				- Watchdog timer
				- ADC
				- Timers
				- Communications with other devices
				- Detecting external signal events
				- Power management
			- Peripherals use interrupts to notify CPU of events
		- Simple systems are usually designed as foreground-background or super-loops. Foreground is also called interrupt level; background is called task level.

			- What is multithreading? #card
 				- Multithreading is a technique that allows a CPU to execute many tasks of one process at the same time.
			- What are hardware peripherals in a microcontroller unit for concurrency? #card
 				- Hardware peripherals are components that add dedicated concurrent processing in a microcontroller unit.
			- What are some examples of hardware peripherals in a microcontroller unit for concurrency? #card
 				- Examples of hardware peripherals include the watchdog timer, ADC, timers, communications with other devices, detecting external signal events, power management, among others.
			- How do peripherals in a microcontroller unit notify the CPU of events? #card
 				- Peripherals use interrupts to notify the CPU of events.
			- What are super-loops in concurrency systems? #card
 				- Super-loops are a way of designing concurrency systems, and they are usually categorized as foreground-background or task level.
			
	- Scheduling
		- Event-triggered scheduling with interrupts relies on the CPU’s hardware interrupt system to run the right code, adequate for simple systems
			- Interrupts provide a basic scheduling approach for CPU in an event-triggered approach
		- Use software to schedule CPU’s time
			- Dynamic priority
				- Without task-level preemption
				- With task-level preemption
			- Static (cyclic executive)
