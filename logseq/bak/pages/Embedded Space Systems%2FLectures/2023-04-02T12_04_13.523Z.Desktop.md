		- Software scheduling of CPU time
			- Dynamic priority
				- It allows schedule to be computed on-the-fly
					- Based on importance
					- Prioritization means that less important tasks don't delay more important ones
				- How often do we decide what to run?
					- Coarse grain: After a task finishes. Also called Run-to-Completion (RTC) or non-preemptive dynamic scheduling.

	- Real-time Operating System
		- Real-time Operating System Definition: A real-time operating system is an operating system that supports the construction of real-time systems
			- Soft and Hard real-time systems depending on how strict have to be the deadlines which must be met.
		- 3 key requirements:
			- 1) The timing behavior of the OS must be predictable. For each service of the OS, an upper bound on the execution time must be guaranteed.
			- 2) OS must manage the timing and scheduling. OS has to be aware of deadlines and should have a mechanism to take them into account in the scheduling. OS must provide precise time services with a high resolution
			- 3) OS must be fast: in addition to being predictable, the OS must be capable of supporting applications with deadlines that are fractions of a second.
		- Why do we need a RTOS? A desktop OS is not suited because:
			- 1) It is designed to serve general purpose use and therefore offers too many features which are not needed for embedded systems which have very specific scopes.
			- 2) These extra features/services take too much memory space and computation time.
			- 3) The timing uncertainty is too large for mission-critical applications.

 				- Predictable timing behavior, timing and scheduling management, and fast performance.
			- Why must the execution time of a real-time operating system be guaranteed? #card
 				- To ensure predictability and meet deadlines.
			- What is the role of an RTOS in scheduling and deadlines? #card
 				- It must be aware of deadlines and incorporate them into its scheduling mechanism.
			- Why is a high-resolution time service necessary? #card
 				- To provide precise time services for real-time applications.
			- Why is a desktop OS not suitable for real-time applications? #card
 				- It has too many features, takes up memory and computation time, and has large timing uncertainty.
			
		- One of the key features of a RTOS for embedded systems is its **configurability**: it must be possible to remove not used components since unnecessary overhead is unacceptable.
		- Embedded OS
			- For embedded OS: Device drivers are typically handled directly by tasks instead of drivers that are managed by the operating system.
			- This architecture improves timing predictability as access to devices is also handled by the scheduler
			- If several tasks use the same external device and the associated driver, then the access must be carefully managed (shared critical resource, avoid race-condition)
		- Functions of a RTOS: the most important function of a RTOS is Task management:
			- Execution of quasi-parallel tasks on a processor using processes or threads (lightweight process) by maintaining process states, process queuing, allowing for preemptive tasks (fast context switching) and quick interrupt handling
			- CPU scheduling (guaranteeing deadlines, minimizing process waiting times, fairness in granting resources such as computing power)
			- Inter-task communication (buffering)
			- Support of real-time clocks
			- Task synchronization (critical sections, semaphores, monitors, mutual exclusion)
				- In classical operating systems, synchronization and mutual exclusion is performed via semaphores and monitors.
				- In real-time OS, special semaphores and a deep integration of them into scheduling is necessary (for example priority inheritance protocols).
		- Task States
			- A RTOS task usually has the following main states:
				- Running State: the task's code is currently being executed by the CPU.
				- Ready State: the task is ready to be put into the running state. In the ready state, the task does not consume any CPU cycles.
				- Blocked State: the task is in this state when it waits for the occurrence of some event. In this state, the task does not consume any cPU cycles.

				- scheduling (determine the timing of individual operations)
				- binding (determine relation between individual operations of the algorithm and hardware resources)
			- Classification of synthesis algorithms
				- heuristics or exact methods
			- Synthesis methods can often be applied independently of granularity of algorithms, e.g. whether operation is a whole complex task or a single operation.
		- Which language to use to specify embedded systems?

	- Space Radiation Environment and Effects on Embedded Systems
		- Ionizing and non-ionising
			- EM radiation becomes ionizing at around 10 eV
			- EM radiation becomes ionizing between 10e15 and 10e16 Hz (between visible and ultraviolet radiation)
		- Interaction of radiation with matter
			- Ionizing radiation is composed of various forms of energetic particles and waves that are capable of dislodging electrons from atoms and molecules, thereby  altering the structure and properties of matter.
			- There are three major types of ionizing radiation: alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays (or photons).
				- Alpha particles are effectively helium nuclei, consisting of two protons and two neutrons, and carrying a positive charge of +2. They are relatively large and slow-moving compared to other ionizing particles, and can be stopped by simple barriers such as paper or skin. However, when they collide with atoms or molecules, they can cause significant damage, especially if they are emitted from heavy isotopes with sufficient energy.
				- Beta particles are electrons or positrons that are emitted from the nucleus during radioactive decay. They carry a negative or positive charge of -1 or +1, respectively, and are generally more energetic and faster-moving than alpha particles. Beta particles can penetrate deeper into matter than alpha particles, but can still be stopped by denser materials like plastic or aluminum.
				- Gamma rays, also known as photons, are high-energy electromagnetic waves that have no mass or charge. They are emitted during nuclear decay or other radioactive processes, and can travel long distances through matter and air. Gamma radiation is highly ionizing, but since it is not composed of particles, it interacts differently with matter than alpha or beta radiation. Instead of directly interacting with atoms, gamma rays are absorbed through a process called Compton scattering, in which they collide with electrons and transfer some of their energy, causing the electrons to become ionized.
			- The interactions between ionizing radiation and matter depend on several factors, including the type and energy of the radiation, the density and composition of the material, and the duration and intensity of exposure. In general, dense materials with high atomic numbers are more effective at stopping ionizing radiation than lighter or less dense materials. However, some types of radiation can still penetrate deeply into matter or cause significant secondary ionization, which can lead to harmful biological effects.

		- Radiation environment in space
			- Three main sources of radiation in space:
				- Trapped particles
					- **Charged particles motion in the Earth magnetic field**
					  The Earth's magnetic field lines trap both protons and electrons (in opposing directions) in a helical movement along the lines. These charged particles originate from sources such as the solar wind, cosmic rays, and the Earth's ionosphere. 
					  Their motion is primarily governed by the Lorentz force, which is the force exerted on charged particles by electric and magnetic fields. When these charged particles encounter the Earth's magnetic field, they interact in a way that causes them to follow a spiraling path along the field lines. This trapping of charged particles is an important aspect of the Earth's magnetosphere, as it helps protect the planet from harmful solar and cosmic radiation.
					- **Van Allen radiation belts**
					  The radiation belts are layers around a planet, trapped by its magnetic field.
					  Earth has 2 belts discovered by Van Allen in 1958.
					  The outer belt consists mainly of high energy (0.1\(10 \mathrm{MeV}\) ) electrons.
					  Altitude: \(13000-60000 \mathrm{~km}\left(3-10\right.\) Earth radii \(\left(R_E\right)\) )
					  Highest intensity: \(\sim 4-5 R_E\).
					  The inner belt consist mainly of high energy protons.
					  Altitude: 1000-6000 km (0.2 to 2 Earth radii \(\left(R_E\right)\) )
					- **South Atlantic Anomaly**
					  The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is an area where the Earth's inner Van Allen belt comes closest to the Earth's surface, as low as 200 km.
					  It is due to the fact that the Earth's magnetic field is not perfectly aligned with its geographic center and poles (offset tilted and distorted dipole). Over SSA the Earth's magnetic field is weakest.

				  Radiation induced charging of the gate oxide in N-Channel MOSFETs occurs when ionizing radiation creates electron-hole pairs within the oxide layer. The holes are trapped at the oxide-silicon interface, while the electrons move towards the gate electrode. As the electrons accumulate at the gate, the threshold voltage of the MOSFET decreases, causing an unwanted change in the device's electrical characteristics. This effect is known as radiation-induced threshold voltage shift.

				- [[GPT Generated Flashcards]]
				  				Radiation can have significant effects on bipolar devices, similar to MOS devices. These effects are mainly due to charge trapping and interface states. The parameter used to describe the amplification of bipolar devices, Î² or hFE, can degrade due to radiation, ultimately leading to a reduction in gain. The increase in ionizing radiation can lead to an increase in the base current, I_B. Additionally, radiation can also cause leakage in the device. Therefore, it is important to consider radiation effects when designing circuits that are intended to operate in radiation-prone environments, such as satellites or nuclear power plants.
