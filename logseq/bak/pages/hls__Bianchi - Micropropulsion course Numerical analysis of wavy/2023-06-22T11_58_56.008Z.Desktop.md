- Given the extremely low Reynolds numbers, the flow was assumed to be completely laminar. The following assumptions were used:• Incompressible flow• Steady state (this was verified with transient simulations)• Negligible radiative and natural convective heat transfer• Negligible viscous dissipation• Laminar flow• Constant fluid properties

- For this reason a second definition of the mean fluid temperature was used, calculated making an average over the whole fluid volume.ℎ = 𝑞𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡 · (𝑇𝑤 − 𝑇𝑚 ) (5)(6) where 𝑇𝑤 is the average temperature of the three heated walls and 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡 is their area.

- To evaluate the pressure losses in the channel the friction factor of the channels is evaluated. This is defined as:𝑓 = −(𝑑𝑝/𝑑𝑥) · 𝐷ℎ12 𝜌𝑈 2 = (𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑒𝑡 − 𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑡 ) · 𝐷ℎ12 𝜌𝑈 2𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑒𝑡 · 𝐿 (9) Here 𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑒𝑡 and 𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑡 are the average pressures over the respective areas. 𝑈𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑒𝑡 is the mean flow velocity, obtained from the mass flow.

- In the context of a VLM, the important parameters to be considered in a design trade off are:• Size.• Wall temperature (given a fixed power): a lower wall temp. aides in heat transfer management.• Pressure losses: these can be seen either as a performance loss or as an increased requirement in the pressure of the propellant tank.

- We know that the Isp can be calculated using:𝐼𝑠𝑝 = 𝐹𝑚𝑔 =√2𝐶𝑝𝑇𝑐 (1 − ( 𝑝𝑒𝑝𝑐 ) 𝛾 −1𝛾 )𝑔 + 𝐴𝑒𝑚𝑔 𝑝𝑐 ( 𝑝𝑒𝑝𝑐) (13) Where 𝐴𝑒 = 5.8 · 10−8 𝑚2 using the Silva’s "wide nozzle", the mass flow considered is 𝑚 = 3.42 𝑚𝑔/𝑠 and the pressure ratio depends on the geometric expansion ratio of the wide nozzle (17) and on the specific heat ratio of water vapour (approximated as 1.31).

- Pressure losses It has been found by Kohl et al. [6 ] that the pressure losses in(straight) microchannel respect the findings of Shah and London[ 8] for macrochannel. They affirm that, for a fully developed flow, the product of the friction factor and the Reynolds number, 𝑓 𝑅𝑒, is constant. Linearly interpolating from Shah’s data, we find that a rectangular channel with an aspect ratio of 𝛼 = 0.4717 as ours is expected to have a 𝑓 𝑅𝑒 = 63.1204. However, given the presence of a pressure drop associated with the developing region, we should expect a measured 𝑓 𝑅𝑒 to behave as depicted by the following equation:𝑓 𝑅𝑒𝑒 𝑓 𝑓 = 𝑓 𝑅𝑒 + 𝐾∞ · 𝑅𝑒 · 𝐷ℎ𝐿 (12)𝐾∞ depends on the aspect ratio, and from Shah’s data is expected to be 𝐾∞ = 1.3542.

- The Nusselt number indicates the ratio between the heat transferred via convection and the heat transferred via conduction. A higher Nusselt number, given the same transferred heat, means having lower wall temperatures.

- In the context of the VLM analyzed here, a lower channel temperature means a simpler heat management. Minimizing the leakage of heat from the thruster to the surrounding environment leads to higher heating efficiency, lowering the power requirements.

- Wavy microchannel can provide better heat exchange in three different ways:• Lateral flows• Dean vortices• Boundary layer thinning Lateral flows. This is a phenomena where vortices are present in the direction of flow. This is not present at the low Reynolds number present in this work. Dean vortices. Dean vortices are a secondary motion super imposed on the primary Poiseuille laminar pipe flow, caused by the curvature of the pipe. This is shown as a pair (or more, according the to the Re number) of counter-rotating cells as seen in Figure 8. This vortices enhance the mixing of hot and cold fluid, leading to higher Nusselt numbers [10]. Boundary layer thinning. While in a straight microchannel the thermal boundary layer thickens along the channel length, given a constant wall temperature condition, in a wavy microchannel the curvature shifts the mean flow to the outer wall of the curved channel. This causes a thinning of both thermal and hydrodynamic boundary layers, meaning better convection happens.
