- Real-time Operating System
	- Real-time Operating System Definition: A real-time operating system is an operating system that supports the construction of real-time systems
		- Soft and Hard real-time systems depending on how strict have to be the deadlines which must be met.
	- 3 key requirements:
		- 1) The timing behavior of the OS must be predictable. For each service of the OS, an upper bound on the execution time must be guaranteed.
		- 2) OS must manage the timing and scheduling. OS has to be aware of deadlines and should have a mechanism to take them into account in the scheduling. OS must provide precise time services with a high resolution
		- 3) OS must be fast: in addition to being predictable, the OS must be capable of supporting applications with deadlines that are fractions of a second.
	- Why do we need a RTOS? A desktop OS is not suited because:
		- 1) It is designed to serve general purpose use and therefore offers too many features which are not needed for embedded systems which have very specific scopes.
		- 2) These extra features/services take too much memory space and computation time.
		- 3) The timing uncertainty is too large for mission-critical applications.

			- It has too many features, takes up memory and computation time, and has large timing uncertainty.
	- One of the key features of a RTOS for embedded systems is its **configurability**: it must be possible to remove not used components since unnecessary overhead is unacceptable.
	- Embedded OS
		- For embedded OS: Device drivers are typically handled directly by tasks instead of drivers that are managed by the operating system.
		- This architecture improves timing predictability as access to devices is also handled by the scheduler
		- If several tasks use the same external device and the associated driver, then the access must be carefully managed (shared critical resource, avoid race-condition)
	- Functions of a RTOS: the most important function of a RTOS is Task management:
		- Execution of quasi-parallel tasks on a processor using processes or threads (lightweight process) by maintaining process states, process queuing, allowing for preemptive tasks (fast context switching) and quick interrupt handling
		- CPU scheduling (guaranteeing deadlines, minimizing process waiting times, fairness in granting resources such as computing power)
		- Inter-task communication (buffering)
		- Support of real-time clocks
		- Task synchronization (critical sections, semaphores, monitors, mutual exclusion)
			- In classical operating systems, synchronization and mutual exclusion is performed via semaphores and monitors.
			- In real-time OS, special semaphores and a deep integration of them into scheduling is necessary (for example priority inheritance protocols).
	- Task States
		- A RTOS task usually has the following main states:
			- Running State: the task's code is currently being executed by the CPU.
			- Ready State: the task is ready to be put into the running state. In the ready state, the task does not consume any CPU cycles.
			- Blocked State: the task is in this state when it waits for the occurrence of some event. In this state, the task does not consume any cPU cycles.

			- Running State.
	- Classes of RTOS
		- Class 1: Fast proprietary kernels
			- Examples: FreeRTOS, QNX, eCOS, RT-LINUX, VxWORKS, LynxOS.
			- For hard real-time systems, these kernels are tricky to use because they are designed to be fast, rather than to be predictable in every respect but they have been successfully used in many NASA missions including: Mars 2020, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Curiosity, Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, Clementine, Phoenix Mars lander, Deep Impact space probe, Mars Pathfinder and Juno.
		- Class 2: Extensions to Standard OSs
			- Attempt to exploit existing and comfortable main stream operating systems.
			- A real-time kernel runs all real-time tasks.
			- The standard-OS is executed as one task
			- Example: RT-Linux runs the standard Linux kernel (or sub-kernel) as the lowest priority task in a simple real-time operating system.
		- Class 3: Research Systems
			- Research systems try to avoid limitations of existing real-time and embedded operating systems.
			- Examples include L4, seL4, NICTA, ERIKA, SHARK
			- Typical Research questions:
				- How to implement memory protection with low overhead.
				- How to use cache memories in RTOS
				- How to develop a RTOS for on-chip multiprocessors (i.e. hypervisors)
				- How to provide quality of service (QoS) control
		- Example: RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems)

	- The RTEMS is an open source Real Time Operating System (RTOS) that supports open standard API such as POSIX.
		- Chosen by ESA since it supports multiple microprocessors developed for use in space including SPARC, ERC32 and LEON, MIPS Mongoose-V, Coldfire, and PowerPC architectures, which are available in space hardened version.
		- Used in all ESA missions since 2006 and also many NASA (e.g. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Dawn Orbiter, Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, James Webb telescope)
		- Recently ported to support Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC.
	- Embedded Systems Architecture Synthesis
		- The scope of an architecture synthesis is to determine a hardware architecture that efficiently executes a given algorithm.
		- Major tasks of architecture synthesis are:
			- allocation (determine the necessary hardware resources)
			- scheduling (determine the timing of individual operations)
			- binding (determine relation between individual operations of the algorithm and hardware resources)
		- Classification of synthesis algorithms
			- heuristics or exact methods
		- Synthesis methods can often be applied independently of granularity of algorithms, e.g. whether operation is a whole complex task or a single operation.
	- Which language to use to specify embedded systems?
		- Requirements are often written in a natural language however this is not the best way to assure completeness and consistency of specifications.
		- We need a specification language, a formal-machine readable language which describes the system at a higher level than a programming language.
		- Specification languages are not directly executed, they describe the what and not the how.

	- Models of Computation
		- The Von Neumann architecture does not describe fully an embedded system!
		- Models of Computation (MoC) describe the mechanism used to perform computations. It defines how a set of inputs is computed to obtain a certain set of output.
		- Models of computation define:
			- a) Components: organization of computation in different components (Procedures, processes, functions, finite state machine.
			- b) Communication protocols: methods for communication between components.
		- Relations between components can be captured in graphs where computations are represented as processes or tasks.
		  An obvious type of relation between computations is their casual dependence (for example a computation can be only executed after an another computation has been completed).
		- These dependencies are captured in dependence graphs.
			- These simple graphs should evolve in task graph which include also:
				- Timing information
				- input/output
				- Access to resources
				- Periodic scheduling
				- Hierarchical nodes

	- Organization of computations
		- Communicating Finite State Machines (CFSMs): based on a finite set of state machines communicating with each other (i/o and transitions between states).
		- Discrete event model: event carry a time stamp and are processed from a event queue sorted by time.
		- Differential equations/polynomials: used for modeling analog circuits and physical systems.
		- Asynchronous message passing: processes communicate by sending messages which can be buffered. The sender does not need to wait for the receiver to be ready. There different implementations for example Dataflow program where the availability of data triggers the possible execution of operations \(\rightarrow\) risk of overflows.
		- Synchronous message passing: processes communicate in a instantaneous actions called rendez-vous. The process which reaches first the point of communication has to wait for the second to complete.
		- Designs starting from non-Von-Neumann models are also called model-based designs where the key idea is to have some abstract mode of the system under design.

	- Model of communication
		- Shared memory: communication is performed by accessing the same memory from all components. In shared memory if write operations are involved, mechanisms for exclusive access must be provided (e.g semaphores, monitors, spin-locks etc.).
			- Message passing: messages are sent and received by the different components. Generally slower than shared memory.
				- Asynchronous message passing or non-blocking
				- Synchronous message passing or blocking communication
			- Extended rendez-vous, remote invocation: the sender is allowed to continue only after receiving an acknowledgment from the recipient.
