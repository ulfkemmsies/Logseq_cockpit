- ## Interrupt 
  An interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention.
  Whenever an interrupt occurs, the controller completes the execution of the current instruction and starts the execution of an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) or Interrupt Handler.
  ISR tells the processor or controller what to do when the interrupt occurs.
  
  Interrupts can be Hardware or Software:
  Hardware interrupts are electric signals often created by a input device (e.g. keyboard, mouse)
  Software interrupts are caused by either an exceptional condition or a special instruction in the instruction set (e.g. divide-by-zero exception)

- ## Polling vs. Interrupts 
  **Polling** is when software continuously monitors the status of other devices to check if an event occurred
  Slow: need to explicitly check to see if switch is pressed
  Wasteful of CPU time: the faster a response we need, the more often we need to check
  Scales badly: difficult to build system with many activities which can respond quickly. Response time depends on all other processing.
  
  **Interrupt** uses special hardware in MCU to detect event, run specific code (ISR) in response
  Efficient: code runs only when necessary (event-based processing)
  Fast: hardware mechanism
  Scales well: allows many multi-threaded embedded systems to be responsive without an operating system (specifically task scheduler)

- ## Interrupt/Exception Processing Sequence 
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1680549400339_0.png) 
  Other code (background) is running
  Interrupt trigger occurs
  Processor does some hard-wired processing
  Processor executes ISR (foreground), including return-from-interrupt instruction at end
  Processor resumes other code
- **Interrupt Response Latency**
  This is an overhead which increases as the interrupt rate rises, delaying our response to external events
  
  How long does it take?
  1. Finish executing the current instruction or abandon it if too long
  2. Push various registers on to the stack, fetch vector
  3. If we have external memory with wait states, this takes longer

- ## Analog to Digital Conversion
  A **Comparator** tells us if the input voltage is smaller than a reference voltage
  Compares an analog input voltage with an analog reference voltage and determines which is larger, returning a 1-bit number
  
  An **Analog to Digital Converter** (AD or ADC) tells us how large the input voltage is as a fraction of the reference voltage.
  Reads an analog input signal (usually a voltage) and produces a corresponding multi-bit number at the output.
	- ### Waveform Sampling and Quantization 
	  ![image.png](../assets/image_1680551442002_0.png) 
	  A waveform is sampled at a constant rate - every \(\Delta t\)
	  Each such sample represents the instantaneous amplitude at the instant of sampling
	  Sampling converts a continuous time signal to a discrete time signal
	  The sample can now be quantized (converted) into a digital value
	  Quantization represents a continuous (analog) value with the closest discrete (digital) value
	- ### Flash Conversion 
	  A multi-level voltage divider is used to set voltage levels over the complete range of conversion.
	  A comparator is used at each level to determine whether the voltage is lower or higher than the level.
	  The series of comparator outputs are encoded to a binary number in digital logic (a priority encoder)
	  ![image.png](../assets/image_1680551522459_0.png){:height 258, :width 334} 
	  Components used
	  \(2^N\) resistors
	  \(2^N-1\) comparators
	- ### Successive Approximation Conversion (SAR)
	  This ADC successively approximates input voltage by using a binary search and a DAC. It performs
	  1. Sample and hold of the analog signal.
	  2. For each bit, the SAR logic outputs a binary code to the DAC that is dependent on the current bit under scrutiny and the previous bits already approximated.
	  3. The comparator is used to determine the state of the current bit.
	  4. Once all bits have been approximated, the digital approximation is output at the end of the conversion (EOC).

	- ### ADC Performance Metrics 
	  Linearity measures how well the transition voltages lie on a straight line.
	  Differential linearity measure the equality of the step size.
	  Conversion time: between start of conversion and generation of result
	  Conversion rate is the inverse of conversion time
	- ### Sampling Problems 
	  Nyquist criterion: the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest analog frequency component
	  Frequency components above 0.5 * the sampling frequency are aliased: distorted measured signals
	  In the real world filters are not perfect (especially Commercial Off The Shelf) therefore so we have to choose a sampling frequency high enough that our filter attenuates aliasing components adequately
	- ### ADC Inputs
	  **Differential**
	  Use two channels, and compute difference between them
	  Very good noise immunity
	  Some sensors offer differential outputs (e.g. Wheatstone Bridge)
	  
	  **Multiplexing**
	  Typically share a single ADC among multiple inputs
	  Need to select an input, allow time to settle before sampling
	  
	  **Signal Conditioning**
	  Amplify and filter input signal
	  Protect against out-of-range inputs with clamping diodes

	- ### Sample and Hold Devices
	  ![image.png](../assets/image_1680552028266_0.png) 
	  Some A/D converters require the input analog signal to be held constant during conversion, (e.g. successive approximation devices)
	  In other cases, peak capture or sampling at a specific point in time necessitates a sampling device.
	  This function is accomplished by a sample and hold device as shown to the right:

- ## Serial Communications 
  Why communicate serially? Native word size is multi-bit (8,16,32, etc.)
  
  In many applications it is not feasible to send all the word bits at the same time
  **Cost and weight:** more wires needed, larger connectors needed
  **Mechanical reliability:** more wires -> more connector contacts to fail
  **Timing Complexity:** some bits may arrive later than others due to variations in capacitance and resistance across conductors
  **Circuit complexity and power:** may not want to have 16 different radio transmitters + receivers in the system
- ### Parallel Buses 
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1680552815318_0.png) 
  All devices use buses to share data, read and write signals
  MCU uses individual select lines to address each peripheral
  MCU requires fewer pins for data, but still one per data bit
  MCU can communicate with only one peripheral at a time
- ### Synchronous Serial Data Transmission 
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1680553159511_0.png) 
  Use shift registers and a clock signal to convert between serial and parallel formats
  Synchronous: an explicit clock signal is along with the data signal
- ### Synchronous Full-Duplex Serial Data Bus 
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1680553267705_0.png) 
  Now can use two serial data lines - one for reading, one for writing.
  Allows simultaneous send and receive
  
  Half-Duplex involves sharing the serial data line, and doesn't allow simultaneous send and receive
- ### Asynchronous Serial Communication
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1680553447141_0.png) 
  Eliminate the clock line!
  Transmitter and receiver must generate clock locally
  Transmitter must add start bit (always same value) to indicate start of each data frame
  Receiver detects leading edge of start bit, then uses it as a timing reference for sampling data line to extract each data bit \(N\) at time \(T_{\text {bit }} *(N+1.5)\)
  Stop bit is also used to detect some timing errors
