- The data points obtained using the WebPlotDigitizer for effective and geometric area ratio are displayed in table 4.15. Additionally, the ratio between the two values is also shown.

The values were plotted in figure 4.18.퐶퐷 = ̇ 푚푚푒푎푠̇푚1퐷= 휌푢퐴푒푓 푓휌푢퐴푔푒표= 퐴푒푓 푓퐴푔푒표(4.26)

- This function finds the best fit for the given values (which in this case are the values of the ratio between effective and geometric area ratio) and displays the equation for that fit, which in this case was a non-linear regression. For these values the relation found was equation 4.27.퐴푒푓 푓퐴푔푒표= 0.322135 − 38.6498푅푒 + 0.063732 ⋅ 푙표푔(푅푒) (4.27)

- The skin friction in the walls of a nozzle cause an effect that reduces the thrust of the propulsion system [17]. This parameter is named “momentum loss thickness” and can be represented to a force that has an axial component in the direction of thrust. By subtracting this amount from the thrust, it is possible to calculate the “measured” thrust and therefore the thrust efficiency [17].Δ퐹 = (휌푒 ⋅ 푢푒 ⋅ 2휋푅푒 ⋅ 휃푒) ⋅ 푢푒

- Another approach that can be taken to calculate the“experimental” value of thrust is using the relation derived by Spisz (1965) [13]. This expression is used to estimate the effect of the viscous forces caused by the boundary layer on the nozzle quality:퐶퐹 = 퐶퐹 ,푖 − 퐶퐹 ,푣푖푠푐 (4.17)퐶퐹 ,푣푖푠푐 = 17.6푒0.0032퐴푒퐴푡√0.773푅푒푡2000 ≤ 푅푒푡 ≤ 10000 (4.18) Where 퐶퐹 is the thrust coefficient corrected for viscous effects, 퐶퐹 ,푖 is the ideal thrust coefficient, and 퐶퐹 ,푣푖푠푐 is the effect of the boundary layer on the thrust coefficient.퐶퐹 ,푖 = 퐹1퐷푝푐 ⋅ 퐴푡(4.19)
