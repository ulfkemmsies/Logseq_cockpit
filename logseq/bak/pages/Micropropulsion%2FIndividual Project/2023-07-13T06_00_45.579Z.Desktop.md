			- Summary:
			  The text discusses the performance of micronozzles under low Reynolds numbers. Three performance parameters, namely thrust efficiency, discharge coefficient, and specific impulse efficiency, are used to study their performance. The theoretical values of these parameters are calculated using the principles of Ideal Rocket Theory. The text also mentions the momentum loss caused by skin friction in the nozzle walls, which reduces the thrust of the propulsion system. The effect of viscous forces on the nozzle quality is estimated using an expression derived by Spisz. The text further discusses the calculation of thrust efficiency and discharge coefficient using different equations. The discharge coefficient is calculated considering the effect of the boundary layer on the nozzle throat area. The values of effective and geometric area ratio for different Reynolds numbers are provided in a table. The discharge coefficient is assumed to be the ratio between effective and geometric area ratio. The text concludes with an equation that represents the best fit for the given values of the ratio between effective and geometric area ratio.

			- The important parameters to be considered in the design trade-off are size, wall temperature, and pressure losses. The wavy microchannel geometry improves convective heat transfer due to boundary layer thinning and the formation of Dean vortices. The Nusselt number is used to indicate the ratio between the heat transferred via convection and the heat transferred via conduction. A higher Nusselt number means having lower wall temperatures, which is critical in Cubesats where available power is often limited. Future work should concentrate on the two sections of the flow that have not been simulated in this work: boiling and vapor.
			- ## Main Equations 
			  The main equations used for modeling heat transfer in the heating chamber are as follows:
			  
			  1. Nozzle model:
			  The mass flow rate at the nozzle, \(\dot{m}_3\), is calculated using the ideal rocket conditions. The mass flow rate equation is given by:
			  \[
			  \dot{m}_3 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \gamma}{R}} \frac{A_t}{A_e} p_1 \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{R T_1}} \left(1 - \left(\frac{p_0}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}\right)
			  \]
			  where \(\gamma\) is the specific heat ratio, \(R\) is the specific gas constant, \(A_t\) is the throat area, \(A_e\) is the exit area, \(p_1\) is the chamber pressure, \(T_1\) is the chamber temperature, and \(p_0\) is the ambient pressure.
			  
			  2. Vaporization model:
			  The average volume of vapor, \(V_{av}\), is calculated as a function of the thruster temperature and pressure:
			  \[
			  V_{av} = a_T T_n + a_p p_1 + b
			  \]
			  where \(a_T\), \(a_p\), and \(b\) are parameters of the linear regression, and \(T_n\) is the temperature of the chip measured around the nozzle.
			  
			  3. Time derivative of volume:
			  The time derivative of the volume, \(\dot{V}\), is assumed to be a first-order linear system:
			  \[
			  \dot{V} = A(V_{av} - V)
			  \]
			  
			  4. Vaporization rate:
			  The vaporization rate, \(\dot{m}_2\), is calculated as the difference between the liquid flow rate, \(\dot{m}_1\), and the time derivative of volume multiplied by the liquid density, \(\rho_l\):
			  \[
			  \dot{m}_2 = \dot{m}_1 - \dot{V} \rho_l
			  \]
			  
			  5. Pressure model:
			  The pressure inside the chamber, \(p\), is calculated using the ideal gas law:
			  \[
			  p = \frac{1}{\alpha_2} \left(\frac{m R_s}{V} - \beta_2\right)
			  \]
			  where \(\alpha_2\) and \(\beta_2\) are coefficients obtained from a linear approximation.
			  
			  6. Chip temperature model:
			  The temperature of the thruster, \(T\), is modeled as a linear first-order system with the applied power, \(P\), as the input. The Laplace transfer function of the power-temperature system is given by:
			  \[
			  \frac{T(s)}{P(s)} = \frac{K}{s + \frac{1}{\tau}}
			  \]
			  where \(\tau\) and \(K\) are experimentally estimated parameters.
			  
			  7. Resistance model:
			  The change in resistance, \(R\), due to temperature changes is described by the equation:
			  \[
			  R = \alpha R_0 (T - T_0) + R_0
			  \]
			  where \(\alpha\) is the temperature coefficient of resistance, \(R_0\) is the resistance measured at temperature \(T_0\), and \(T\) is the current temperature.
			- ## Main assumptions 
			  The model makes several assumptions and uses equations to describe heat transfer in the heating chamber. Here are the key assumptions and equations:
			  
			  1. Nozzle Model:
			  The temperature of the gas is assumed to be the saturation temperature.
			  The temperature of the vapor can be calculated based on the pressure using the Antoine equation.
			  The mass flow rate through the nozzle is given by an equation, which can be multiplied by a discharge coefficient to account for non-ideal conditions.
			  
			  2. Vaporization Model:
			  The average volume of vapor is expressed as a function of the temperature and pressure.
			  The time derivative of the volume is assumed to follow a first-order linear system.
			  The vaporization rate is calculated based on the mass flow rate of the liquid and the rate of change of volume.
			  
			  3. Pressure Model:
			  The ideal gas law is used to relate pressure, temperature, volume, and mass of gas.
			  The term "p/T" is approximated by a linear relation, resulting in a simplified equation for pressure.
			  
			  4. Chip Temperature Model:
			  The temperature of the thruster is modeled as a linear first-order system with the applied power as the input.
			  The Laplace transfer function is used to describe the power-temperature relationship.
			  The change in resistance due to temperature changes is described by an equation involving the resistance at a reference temperature and a temperature coefficient.
			  
			  These assumptions and equations provide a framework for understanding heat transfer in the heating chamber of the model.

		- Propulsion background (common equations)
			- The equations for analyzing the performance of micropropulsion systems are given by:
			  Thrust (F): $F = \dot{m}V_e + (p_e - p_a)A_e$
			  
			  Exhaust velocity (V_e): $V_e = M_e\sqrt{kRT_1}$
			  
			  Mass flow rate ($\dot{m}$): \(\dot{m}=A_t p_1 k \frac{\sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{k+1}\right)^{\frac{k+1}{k-1}}}}{\sqrt{k R T_1}}\)

			- The Reynolds number of the flow in a nozzle is a good measure for how large exactly this boundary layer is, and is traditionally given by
			  \(R e=\frac{\rho \cdot v \cdot D}{\mu}\).
			  Smaller nozzles will naturally cause the flow Reynolds number to become very small.

				- Divergence Losses 
				  When the exit half angle of a nozzle is greater than 0Â°, the gases ejected from the nozzle are not parallel to the direction of thrust. This results in momentum components in directions perpendicular to the thrust vector. However, since the nozzle is symmetric, these perpendicular momentum components cancel each other out and do not cause thrust misalignment. Nevertheless, they contribute to a loss in thrust as not all momentum is effectively used to propel the spacecraft forward.
				  
				  The divergence thrust correction factor, denoted as Îµ_div, quantifies this loss. It is calculated using the equation:
				  
				  \(\epsilon_{div} = 1 - \frac{1 - \cos(\alpha)}{2}\)
				  
				  where Î± represents the exit half angle of the nozzle. This loss factor depends solely on the exit half angle and affects both large and small nozzles.
				- Boundary Layer Losses
				  The boundary layer is formed along the nozzle wall due to viscous flow effects, causing the flow to slow down near the walls and deflect the full flow. This phenomenon is more significant in micro-nozzles due to their low Reynolds number, which increases the skin friction coefficient and causes larger boundary layers.
				  
				  Characterizing the boundary layer is crucial for predicting performance losses in micro-nozzles. A simplified model using flat plate boundary layer solutions can be used for linear convergent-divergent micro-nozzles. The skin friction coefficient for incompressible, laminar flow is given by the equation \(c_{f x}=\frac{0.664}{\sqrt{R e_x}}\), where \(R e_x\) is the Reynolds number.
				  
				  The momentum thickness (\(\theta_x\)) and displacement thickness (\(\delta^*\)) are given by
				  \(\begin{gathered}\theta_x=c_{f x} \cdot x \\ \delta^*=2.59036 \cdot \theta_x\end{gathered}\)
				  respectively. The displacement thickness represents how much the flow is displaced by the boundary layer. The angle of the nozzle divergent should be optimized to balance displacement thickness and divergence losses. The true area ratio of the nozzle can be calculated using \(\left(\frac{A_e}{A_t}\right)_{t r u e}=\frac{2 \cdot\left(R_e-\delta^*\right)}{W_t}\), where \(W_t\) is the throat width.
				  
				  It is important to note that the assumptions made in this boundary layer solution include laminar and attached flow, as well as the assumption that the boundary layer starts developing at the throat and increases in size until the nozzle exit.
				- Momentum Losses
				  The presence of a boundary layer in addition to the modification of effective nozzle geometry leads to momentum losses in the flow. These losses occur as the flow loses momentum within the boundary layer. To account for this, the thrust loss due to momentum can be calculated using the equation:
				  
				  \(\Delta F_{\text {momentum }}=\left(\rho_c \cdot u_c \cdot\left(2 \pi R_c\right) \cdot \theta_c\right) \cdot u_e\)
				  
				  It is important to note that for nozzles with non-circular cross sections, the circumference term should be replaced with the equivalent perimeter.
			- Reference Temperature Approach
			  The previous section discussed a method for predicting boundary layer properties assuming incompressible flow. However, when the flow becomes supersonic, this assumption is no longer valid. To account for this, the "Reference Temperature Approach" corrects the skin friction coefficient using an average temperature across the boundary layer. The correction can be calculated using the equation:
			  
			  \[c_f=c_{f, i}\left(\frac{T_w / T_0+1}{2}+0.22 \frac{\gamma-1}{2} M^2\right)^{-0.6}\]
			  
			  where \(T_w\) is the wall temperature and \(T_0\) is the stagnation temperature at the point where the skin friction coefficient is determined. In this context, we only consider the exit stagnation temperature, as the characteristics of the flat plate boundary layer will be determined at the exit of the nozzle to quantify the loss in exit area. The exit total temperature (\(T_{0_e}\)) can be calculated using isentropic relations:
			  
			  \[T_{0_e}=T_e \cdot\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2} \cdot M_e^2\right)\]
			  
			  This equation can be used for any point along the nozzle, as long as the corresponding flow Mach number (\(M_e\)) is used.
			- Aggregate Performance Loss
			  To calculate the aggregate performance loss, a step-by-step procedure is followed. First, independent loss factors not affected by boundary layer effects are determined. The divergence thrust correction factor is calculated based on the divergent half angle. Then, the properties of the boundary layer, such as the compressible skin friction coefficient, exit momentum thickness, and exit displacement thickness, are calculated using known flow parameters.
			  
			  The following steps are taken to account for boundary layer effects:
			  
			  1. Thrust reduction due to momentum loss is determined based on the momentum thickness.
			  2. The true area ratio is determined based on the displacement thickness.
			  3. The true area ratio leads to a lower exit pressure than predicted by IRT (Isentropic Relation Theory). The effective pressure ratio and exit pressures are iteratively determined using the equation:
			  
			  \(\frac{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{e}}}{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}}=\frac{\Gamma}{\sqrt{\frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma-1} \cdot\left(\frac{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{e}}}{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{c}}}\right)^{\left(\frac{2}{\gamma}\right)}\left(1-\left(\frac{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{e}}}{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{c}}}\right)^{\left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right)}\right)}}\)
			  
			  4. The resulting aggregate thrust loss is calculated by combining the divergence loss, momentum loss, and reduced exit pressure. The true thrust, estimated using this methodology, is given by:
			  
			  \(F_{\text {true }}=m \cdot \epsilon_{\text {div }} \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{A}}}{\mathrm{M}} \cdot \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{c}} \cdot\left(1-\left(\frac{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{e}}}{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{c}}}\right)_{\text {true }}^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}\right)}-\Delta F_{\text {momentum }}\)
			  
			  Finally, the thrust coefficient can be determined using the equation:
			  
			  \(C_{F_{\text {true }}}=\frac{F_{\text {true }}}{p_c \cdot A_t}\)
		- Wavy chambers project
			- Given the extremely low Reynolds numbers, the flow was assumed to be completely laminar. The following assumptions were used:
			  â¢ Incompressible flow
			  â¢ Steady state (this was verified with transient simulations)
			  â¢ Negligible radiative and natural convective heat transfer
			  â¢ Negligible viscous dissipation
			  â¢ Laminar flow
			  â¢ Constant fluid properties
			- Constant heat flux and constant wall temperature were assumed, with a wall temperature of 370 K and a constant heat flux chosen so that the water in the chambers would not exceed 370 K, thus remaining liquid.
			- Performance factors
				- The Nusselt number is a dimensionless parameter used in heat transfer analysis to quantify the relationship between convective and conductive heat transfer across a boundary or surface. It considers factors such as thermal conductivity, fluid properties, and flow characteristics. For low Reynolds numbers (between 10 and 100), the Nusselt number increases significantly with increasing Reynolds numbers. Studies have shown that wavy microchannels result in higher Nusselt numbers and improved convective heat transfer compared to straight channels of the same size. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased pressure losses. The Nusselt number, which evaluates the performance of the channels, can be calculated using the equation: \(N u=\frac{h \cdot D_h}{k_W}\), where \(h\) is the convective heat transfer coefficient, \(D_h\) is the hydraulic diameter, and \(k_W\) is the thermal conductivity.
				- The heat transfer coefficient is calculated using:
				  $$
				  h=\frac{q}{A_{\text {wall heat }} \cdot\left(T_w-T_m\right)}
				  $$
				  where \(T_w\) is the average temperature of the three heated walls and \(A_{\text {wall heat }}\) is their area.
				- The mean fluid temperature was calculated making an average over the whole fluid volume due to the constant wall temperature assumption. The mean fluid temperature, \(T_m\), is calculated with the following two methods:
				  $$
				  \begin{array}{r}
				  T_m=0.5 \cdot\left(T_{\text {in }}+T_{\text {out }}\right) \\
				  T_{m, \text { volAve }}=\frac{\int_{V_{\text {fluid }}} T d V}{V_{\text {fluid }}}
				  \end{array}
				  $$
				  Note that the inlet and outlet bulk temperature are calculated using the mass flow average over the respective areas.
				- To evaluate the pressure losses in the channel the friction factor of the channels is evaluated. This is defined as:
				  $$
				  f=\frac{\left(p_{\text {inlet }}-p_{\text {outlet }}\right) \cdot D_h}{\frac{1}{2} \rho U_{\text {inlet }}^2 \cdot L}
				  $$
				  Here \(p_{\text {inlet }}\) and \(p_{\text {outlet }}\) are the average pressures over the respective areas. \(U_{\text {inlet }}\) is the mean flow velocity, obtained from the mass flow. \(L\) is the centerline length.
				- The Reynolds number is calculated as:
				  $$
				  R e=\frac{m \cdot D_h}{A_{\text {inlet }} \cdot \mu}
				  $$
				  which is an equivalent and more useful (for dimensioning, given the density of water is known) version of
				  \(R e=\frac{\rho \cdot v \cdot D}{\mu}\)
