- Embedded Systems Memory Types
	- Fixed
		- The content of the memory is physically fixed by the structure of the memory element.
		- Examples: core rope memories (wire wound through or around a core, used in Apollo) or antifuse-based PROMs (Programmable Read-Only Memories).
		- Fixed
	- Erasable
		- The contents of the memory is non-volatile, but the contents can be changed. In many cases this involves an erase operation and then a write.
		- Examples: core, plated wire, electrically erasable programmable read only memories (EEPROM), erasable read only memories (EPROM), ferroelectric memories, and flash.
	- Volatile
		- The content of the memory is volatile: these memories do not retain content either after the cycling of power or during "brown out" conditions.
		- Examples: SRAM, DRAM, and SDRAM
	- Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs)
		- PROMs are used in digital electronic devices to store permanent data, usually low level programs such as firmware.
		- Each bit contains both a fuse and an antifuse and is programmed by triggering one of the two.
		- Difference between ROM and PROM is that data are written into ROM at manufacturing while PROM are programmed once after manufacturing.

	- Volatile memories
		- Random Access Memory (RAM) are volatile memories: retains the data bits in its memory as long as power is being supplied.
		- RAM is a semiconductor device internal to the integrated chip that stores data or machine code.
		- The Random-Access allows to read/write in the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of the data inside the memory.
		- There are 2 main types of volatile memories:
		- DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)
			- The Dynamic Random Access Memory is a type of RAM module that stores each bit of data within a separate capacitor. The level of charge on the memory cell capacitor determines whether that particular bit is a logical "1" or "0" (charge present = logical "1" and charge absent \(=\) logical "0").
			- This is an efficient way to store the data in memory because it requires less physical space to store the data.
			- It is also very simple and as a result it can be densely packed on a silicon chip and this makes it very cheap.
			- A particular size of DRAM can hold more amounts of data than a SRAM chip with the same size.
			- The capacitors in DRAM need to be constantly recharged to keep their charge. This is the reason why DRAM requires more power.
		- SRAM (Static Random Access Memory).
			- Single bit is stored in a bi-stable circuit
			- SRAM does not need to be refreshed periodically.
			- SRAMs provide fast access to the data.
			- Almost all the 'on chip' volatile memories in microcontrollers and processors (like caches and register file within the processor core) are made with SRAM allowing high performances and lower power consumption (against a lower density)

- Memory mapping
	- Memory mapping is a common technique for interfacing a peripheral to a processor.
	- With memory mapping a set of functions or settings are broken out and mapped to a set of values that are selected by a given address.
	- [[GPT Generated Flashcards]]
		- What is memory mapping? #card
			- A technique for interfacing a peripheral to a processor.
		- What happens to functions or settings in memory mapping? #card
			- They are mapped to a set of values.

	- Example: the PORT registers of an ATmega microcontroller (used in Arduino).
		- If in the code you write something like PORTB 0xAA, this will set the 8 IO pins designated to PORTB to the value 0xAA.
		- PORTB is a pointer to a special memory address. This address in memory maps to an IO peripheral that takes the value and outputs it to the IO pins.

		- always full-duplex: it communicates in both directions simultaneously
		- a speed of several Mbps can be achieved
		- transfer data in 4 to 16 bit serial packets
		- SPI Timing
			- In addition to setting the clock frequency, the master must also configure the clock polarity and phase with respect to the data
			- CPOL determines the polarity of the clock which can be converted
			- CPOL=0 is a clock which idles at 0 , and each cycle consists of a pulse of 1 . That is, the leading edge is a rising edge, and the trailing edge is a falling edge.
			- CPOL=1 is a clock which idles at 1 , and each cycle consists of a pulse of 0 . That is, the leading edge is a falling edge, and the trailing edge is a rising edge.
			- CPHA determines the phase of the data bits relative to the clock pulses.
			- CPHA=0 cycle consists of a half cycle with the clock idle, followed by a half cycle with the clock asserted.
			- CPHA=1 cycle consists of a half cycle with the clock asserted, followed by a half cycle with the clock idle.

	- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
		- I2C is a synchronous communication protocol => an explicit clock signal shared between sender and receiver.
		- In addition to a clock signal, called SCL, an I2C bus has a data signal called SDA.
		- The bus is considered idle when both SCL and SDA lines are high.
		- To initiate communication the bus master sends a start condition. which means driving SDA low while SCL is high.
		- When the bus master has completed its interaction with the slave device, the bus master asserts a STOP condition, pulling the SDA line high while the SCL line is high.

				- SCL and SDA.
			- What causes the bus to be considered idle? #card
				- Both SCL and SDA lines being high.
			- How does the bus master initiate communication? #card
				- By sending a start condition (driving SDA low while SCL is high).
			- What does the bus master assert after completing interaction with the slave device? #card
				- A STOP condition (pulling the SDA line high while the SCL line is high).
		- I2C Pros and Cons
			- I2C Pros
				- I2C Pros: Flexibility The I2C protocol supports multimaster, multi-slave communication which can add functionalities to the embedded system.
				- Addressing feature It is easy to add components to the bus without any complexity.
				- Simplicity It requires only two bidirectional signal lines to establish communication among multiple devices and the pin count is low as well.
				- Error handling mechanism Error detection and correction relies on ACK/NACK feature (ACK stands for Acknowledgement whereas NACK means No Acknowledgement).
				- Adaptable The I2C protocol is adaptable in the sense that it can work well with both slow ICs and fast ICs.

			- I2C Cons
				- I2C Cons: Conflicts due to chip addressing.
				- Slower speeds I2C protocol uses pull-up resistors rather than the push-pull ones used by its peers. Due to the open-drain design, the speed is limited.
				- Requires more space The pullup resistors on which the protocol is based require quite some space.

	- USB (Universal Serial Bus)
		- A USB system consists of a host with one or more downstream ports, and multiple peripherals.
		- USB device communication is based on **pipes** (logical channels).
		- A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity within a device, called an **endpoint**.
		- There are two types of pipe: **stream** and **message**.
			- A message pipe is bi-directional and is used for **control transfers**. Typically used for short, simple commands to the device, and for status responses from the device.
			- A stream pipe is a uni-directional pipe connected to a unidirectional endpoint that transfers data using:
				- **Isochronous transfer**: real-time data such as audio and video which require fixed bandwidth.
				- **Interrupt transfer**: used when data is sent regularly, for example for status updates.
				- **Bulk transfer**: used to send data where timing is not important, for example to a printer.
