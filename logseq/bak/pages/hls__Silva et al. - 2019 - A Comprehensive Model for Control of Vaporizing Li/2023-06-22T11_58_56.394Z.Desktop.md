- As the mass flow rates considered are in terms of milligrams per second, we assume that the changes in the mass of propellant do not influence the spacecraft dynamics

- In order to model this dynamics we divided the model of the microthruster into four parts: the nozzle model that provides the mass flow rate  ̇m3 based on the pressure in the chamber, the vaporization model which calculates the volumetric fraction of vapor inside the chamber, the pressure model that calculates the pressure inside the chamber based on the density of the vapor part, and the temperature model that relates the thruster temperature to the applied power.

- As the propellant is boiling inside the chamber, we assume that the temperature of the gas is the saturation temperature. With this assumption, the temperature of the vapor can be calculated based on the pressure using (11) known as the Antoine equation.

  VLM system showing a tank (1), a valve (2), a thruster (3), and sensors(4). The mass flow rate  ̇m1 is the liquid flow rate,  ̇m2 is the vaporization rate, and  ̇m3 is the mass flow of the nozzle.
- Nozzle model
	- ) Nozzle model: To model the mass flow rate at the nozzle ̇m3, the ideal rocket conditions are assumed [9, p. 46]. In reality, the following assumptions of the ideal rocket theory do not apply to the microthruster considered in this paper:• adiabatic flow: the flow is not adiabatic since the nozzle is heated up together with the complete thruster, therefore there is heat transfer from the nozzle to the gas.• negligible friction: the friction and boundary layer effects are not negligible due to the size of the thruster.• uniform distribution: the gas velocity, pressure, temperature, and density are not uniform across any section normal to the nozzle axis due to friction and boundary layer effects. Nonetheless, we assume that the changes generated by these effects can be neglected in order to simplify the modeling. Then the mass flow going through the nozzle is given by (3). The second and third assumptions might be compensated by multiplying the mass flow rate by a discharge coefficient which can be experimentally measured for the specific device [11].

	  where A = 10.27, B = 1810.94, and C = 28.67 for pressure in Pa and temperature in the range 372.15–647.15 K.
	- If we consider the pressure in the range 1–5 bar, then we can replace the term \(\frac{p_1}{\sqrt{T_1}}\) in (3) with a function of the pressure:

	  \(\frac{p_1}{\sqrt{T_1}}=\frac{p_1}{\sqrt{\frac{B}{A-\log _{10} p_1}+C}} \approx \alpha_1 p_1+\beta_1\)
	  where α1 and β1 are the coefficients of the first order Taylor series expansion and are functions of the parameters used in(11) and the linearization point ps:
	  \(\alpha_1=\frac{C \log _{10}\left(p_s\right)^2-(2 A C+B) \log _{10}\left(p_s\right)+A(A C+B)-\frac{B}{\ln (10)}}{\left(C+\frac{B}{\left(A-\log _{10}\left(p_s\right)\right)}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\left(A-\log _{10}\left(p_s\right)\right)^2}\)
	  \(\beta_1=\frac{p_s}{\sqrt{C+\frac{B}{\left(A-\log _{10}\left(p_s\right)\right)}}}-\alpha_1 p_s\)
- Vaporization Model
	- Then, the average volume of vapor \(V_{av}\) is written as a function of the temperature of the thruster and the pressure:

	  \(V_{a v}=a_T T_n+a_p p_1+b\)
	  where aT , ap, and b are the parameters of the linear regression and Tn is the temperature of the chip measured around the nozzle.
	- In order to complete the model, we need an expression for the time derivative of the volume which in this analysis has been assumed to be a first-order linear system of the form:

	- the vaporization rate \(\dot{m}_2\)can be calculated as follows:

	  where \( \rho_l \) is the density of the liquid

	  $$
	  \frac{p}{T} V=m R_s
	  $$
	  where \(m\) is the mass of gas. Following a similar approach as the linear approximation used in the nozzle model, we can approximate the term \(\frac{p}{T}\) by a linear relation reducing the equation to:
	  $$
	  p=\frac{1}{\alpha_2}\left(\frac{m R_s}{V}-\beta_2\right)
	  $$
	  where:
	  $$
	  \alpha_2=\frac{C \log _{10}\left(p_s\right)^2-(2 A C+B) \log _{10}\left(p_s\right)+A(A C+B)-\frac{B}{\ln (10)}}{\left(B-C \log _{10}\left(p_s\right)+A C\right)^2}
	  $$
	  $$
	  \beta_2=\frac{p_s}{\sqrt{C+\frac{B}{\left(A-\log _{10}\left(p_s\right)\right)}}}-\alpha_2 p_s
	  $$
- Chip temperature model
	- 4) Chip Temperature Model: The temperature of the thruster is modeled as a linear first-order system whose input is the applied power. The Laplace transfer function of the powertemperature system is given by (23):

	  \frac{T(s)}{P(s)}=\frac{K}{s+\frac{1}{\tau}}
	  $$
	  where \(\tau=119.5 \mathrm{~s}\) and \(K=28.5 \mathrm{KW}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\) have been experimentally estimated using data of power and temperature.
	- The change in resistance due to changes in the temperature is described by the following equation:

	  R=\alpha R_0\left(T-T_0\right)+R_0
	  $$
	  where \(R\) is the resistance, \(T\) is the current temperature, and \(R_0\) is the resistance measured at temperature \(T_0\). The value of \(\alpha\) has been experimentally characterized for many devices and on average is \(\alpha=1.09 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\) [8].
