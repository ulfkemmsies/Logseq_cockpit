		- ## Cold Gas Systems
		  collapsed:: true
			- In cold gas systems, the propellant is stored at high pressure (usually in its liquid phase to allow for higher density and therefore reduced volume, but in principle it can also be stored in the gaseous phase) and accelerated in a nozzle without any additional heating or energy input. If the propellant is stored as a liquid, it is vaporized before reaching the nozzle.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 14
			  hl-color:: yellow
			- In micro-thrusters typically the pressure regulator is not present due to mass and volume limitations (in particular when the propellant is stored in the gaseous phase), and the only required power is to activate the valve and keep it open when needed.
			  hl-page:: 14
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: yellow
			- In absence of the pressure regulator, the gaseous propellant storage pressure in the tank continuously decreases while propellant is extracted from it (blow-down operation)
			  hl-page:: 14
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: yellow
			- Blowdown operation is the process of releasing pressurized gas from a tank in a rocket in order to feed propellant to the engine. During blowdown operation, there is no active control over the gas pressure, which decreases steadily as the propellant is consumed.
			- [[gpt]]

			  Question: What is blowdown operation?
			  Answer: Releasing pressurized gas from a tank in a rocket to feed propellant to the engine.
			  
			  Question: What happens to gas pressure during blowdown operation?
			  Answer: It decreases steadily as the propellant is consumed.
			- If the extraction of propellant is not too fast, it can be assumed that the blow-down process is isothermal and, therefore, the pressure $p_T$ and mass $M_T$ of propellant in the tank change according to the following relationship: \(\frac{p_T}{M_T}=\) constant
			  hl-page:: 15
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: yellow
			- given the continuous reduction of tank pressure in non-regulated systems, and remembering from equation (1.12) that the thrust is proportional to the propellant inlet pressure, it can be inferred that the thrust level provided by these systems is not constant and continuously decreasing with time during operation in orbit.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 15
			  hl-color:: yellow
			- Typical propellants for cold gas micro-thrusters are Isobutane, refrigerants (such as R236fa or R134a), Sulfur Dioxide, Sulfur Hexafluoride, but also more common gases such as Nitrogen, Argon, Xenon.

		- ## Mono-Propellant Systems
		  collapsed:: true
			- In mono-propellant systems, the propellant is typically stored in its liquid phase and pressurized by a pressurant gas which is usually stored separately, with a pressure regulator between the two tanks in order to ensure for constant nozzle inlet pressure and, therefore, constant thrust. By opening the thrust valve, the propellant is then flown into the decomposition chamber, where it chemically decomposes into simpler molecules generating heat and, therefore, entering the nozzle inlet at high temperature. Decomposition is usually facilitated by a catalyst, but also requires in most cases pre-heating of the propellant which, in turn, requires a non-negligible amount of satellite power.

		- ## Bi-Propellant Systems
		  collapsed:: true
			- In Bi-Propellant systems, instead of one single propellant there are two of them (an oxidizer and a fuel), also in this case stored in their liquid phase and pressurized by a pressurant gas usually stored separately, with a pressure regulator (R) between the two tanks in order to ensure for constant nozzle inlet pressure and, therefore, constant thrust. Two thrust valves are present in this case, through which the propellants flow into the combustion chamber, where a chemical reaction between fuel and oxidizer generates heat and allows them to enter the nozzle inlet at high temperature.
			  hl-page:: 17
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: green
			- Not many bi-propellant systems are currently available at the micro-scale and they are usually characterized by a relatively high trust level compared to other micropropulsion systems, mainly due to down-scaling issues related to the residence time of propellants in the combustion chamber
			  ls-type:: annotation

			  Answer: Relatively high trust level.
			- the combustion temperature in bi-propellant systems is normally significantly higher than mono-propellant systems, which allows for higher specific impulse but also causes more significant thermal issues.
			  hl-page:: 17
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: green
			- Bi-propellant systems use Nitrous Oxide+Propene and liquid water (which is then converted to Hydrolox through electrolysis) as propellants

		- ## Solid Propellant Systems
		  collapsed:: true
			- Solid propellant systems are basically the same as bi-propellant ones, with the only difference that propellants are stored in solid phase in the same grain, and require energy from an igniter to start their combustion.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 18
			  hl-color:: blue
			- they suffer from the fact that combustion of a single grain, once initiated, can not be stopped and will continue until the propellants are completely consumed.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 18
			  hl-color:: blue
			- This category of propulsion systems have not been extensively developed yet for small satellites due to the typical limitations on pyrotechnic devices present in the requirements for this class of satellites
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 18
			  hl-color:: blue
			- some systems characterized by significantly high thrust levels(in the range 10-100 N) have been proposed for specific applications, such as de-orbiting at the satellite end of life.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 18
			  hl-color:: blue
			- [[gpt]]
			  Question: What is the main difference between solid propellant systems and bi-propellant systems?
			  Answer: Solid propellants are stored in the same grain and require an igniter to start combustion.
			  
			  Question: Can the combustion of a single grain in solid propellant systems be stopped once initiated?
			  Answer: No, it cannot be stopped and continues until the propellants are completely consumed.

			- the regression rate r of the solid propellant grain has to be taken into account. In the simplest possible approximation, the regression rate can be estimated as a function of the combustion chamber pressure through the following equation: \(r=a \cdot p_C^n\)
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 18
			  hl-color:: blue
			- where a is the temperature coefficient and n is the combustion index (normally lower than 1), both characteristic of the specific solid propellant grain.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 19
			  hl-color:: blue
			- The mass flow rate can then be calculated as: \(\dot{m}=r \cdot \rho_P \cdot A_b\) where $\rho_P$ is the propellant grain density and $A_b$ is its instantaneous burning surface.
			  hl-page:: 19
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: blue
			- it is clear that the chamber pressure evolution over time, and therefore the thrust evolution over time, are a direct consequence of how the grain burning surface changes over time. By selecting a grain geometry with increasing, decreasing or constant burning surface, it is possible to also obtain increasing, decreasing or constant chamber pressure and thrust.

		- ## Micro-Resistojets
		  collapsed:: true
			- Resistojets can be seen as an intermediate concept between electrical and chemical propulsion since the propellant is heated electrically (typically by means of a resistance) and accelerated in a convergent-divergent nozzle.
			  hl-page:: 19
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: purple
			- In principle, any propellant can be used, stored in any phase (liquid, solid or gaseous); in practice, however, liquid propellants are the most widely used. An alternative to liquid propellants are the socalled warm gas thrusters, which are basically cold gas systems allowing for additional(usually limited) heating of the gaseous propellant before being accelerated in the nozzle.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 19
			  hl-color:: purple
			- resistojets are very similar to cold gas thrusters: the propellant is stored in a tank, pressurized (when in the liquid phase) by a pressurant gas and injected in the heating chamber by opening a thrust valve. 
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 19
			  hl-color:: purple
			- A pressure regulator is usually not included, meaning that the operation is typically blow-down and the pressure (and thrust) provided by the system are decreasing over its lifetime.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 20
			  hl-color:: purple
			- The specific impulse, although higher than cold gas systems due to the higher temperature of the propellant and the nozzle inlet, is still limited due to the limitations in the available heating power.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 20
			  hl-color:: purple
			- [[gpt]]
			  Question: How are resistojets different from traditional chemical propulsion?

			  Question: What is a key advantage of resistojets compared to cold gas systems?
			  Answer: Higher specific impulse.
			  
			  Question: What are warm gas thrusters?
			  Answer: Cold gas systems allowing for limited heating of the gaseous propellant.
			  
			  Question: How is propellant stored in resistojets?
			  Answer: In a tank, pressurized by a pressurant gas.
			  
			  Question: Which phase of propellant is most commonly used in resistojets?
			  Answer: Liquid phase.
			  
			  Question: What is the main limitation in resistojet's specific impulse?
			  Answer: The available heating power.
			  
			  Question: Why do resistojets typically operate in blow-down mode?
			  Answer: Pressure regulators are usually not included.
			- Since the propellant is accelerated in a nozzle, equation (1.5) for the mass flow rate is still valid; however, for the most common case of a liquid propellant that needs to be vaporized before being accelerated in the nozzle, it has to be combined with the following relationship that characterizes the vaporization and heating of the propellant: \(P_h=\dot{m} \cdot\left[c_{p L} \cdot\left(T_{b o i l}-T_0\right)+L_h+c_{p G} \cdot\left(T_C-T_{\text {boil }}\right)\right]\)
			  hl-page:: 20
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: purple
			  where \(P_h\) is the available heating power, \(T_0\) is the initial propellant temperature, \(T_{\text {boil }}\) is the propellant boiling temperature (which in turn is a function of the heating chamber pressure), \(c_{p L}\) and \(c_{p G}\) are the constant pressure specific heat of respectively the liquid and gaseous propellant phase (both usually functions of the temperature), \(L_h\) is the latent heat of vaporization of the propellant.
			- given a desired temperature at which the propellant has to be heated, the required heating power to achieve that temperature will be a function of the propellant pressure and, therefore, in a system without pressure regulator it will vary over the lifetime of the system.

			  Question: What equation represents the mass flow rate for micropropulsion?
			  Answer: Equation (1.5)
			  
			  Question: What is the equation for available heating power in micropropulsion?
			  Answer: \(P_h=\dot{m} \cdot\left[c_{p L} \cdot\left(T_{b o i l}-T_0\right)+L_h+c_{p G} \cdot\left(T_C-T_{\text {boil }}\right)\right]\)

			  Answer: Latent heat of vaporization of the propellant
			  
			  Question: What factors affect the required heating power for micropropulsion?
			  Answer: Propellant pressure and desired temperature
			  
			  Question: Name three propellants commonly used in micro-resistojets.
			  Answer: Liquid water, R134a refrigerant, and ammonia
			- TU Delft is currently working at a micro-resistojet system for small satellites using liquid water as propellan
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 20
			  hl-color:: purple
			- The choice of water is not only driven by the fact that it is a safe, easy to handle, cheap propellant, but also by a thorough analysis which has shown that, among all propellants that can be stored as a liquid at ambient temperature and relatively low pressure (no more than 10 bar), water is the fluid which allows for the best combination of specific impulse and tank volume for a given Delta-V requirement, thanks to its relatively low molecular mass and high density, in spite of the high value of its heat of vaporization

		- ## Ion Thrusters and RF Electric Thrusters
		  collapsed:: true
			- In the classical concept, ions are generated by electron bombardment, i.e. by collisions between propellant molecules and electrons injected in the ionization chamber. The ions are then accelerated by two grids between which a potential drop is applied. Since the expelled ions are positively charged, it is important to expel an equal number of negatively charged particles (electrons) in order to keep the spacecraft neutral. This is done by a component called neutralizer, which is basically the same as the component which injects the electrons in the ionization chamber.

			- Radio-Frequency electric thrusters are based on exactly the same working principle as ion thrusters, with the only difference that propellant is not ionized by electron bombardment, but by Radio Frequency (RF) power provided by coils wrapped around the ionization chamber, creating an azimuthally oscillating electric field to generate the ions.
			  hl-page:: 21
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: yellow

		- ## Hall Effect Thrusters
		  collapsed:: true
			- in Hall Effect thrusters, thrust is generated by first ionizing and then accelerating the propellant. However, in this case, a different acceleration mechanism is used, based on mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields applied to the ionization chamber. As in ion thrusters, electrons are injected in the ionization chamber. As a consequence of the Hall effect, they start moving in a spiral trajectory with velocity perpendicular to both the magnetic field B and the electric field E. Ionization of the propellant, as usual, is obtained through collisions between these electrons and the propellant molecules, and propellant ions are then accelerated by the applied electric field. Therefore, no grids are needed in this case to accelerate the propellant, and they are replaced in practice by the applied magnetic field which, in a typical Hall Effect thruster, is radial.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 23
			  hl-color:: red
			  hl-stamp:: 1683191745086
			- Hall Effect thrusters are typically characterized by high specific impulse (although slightly lower than ion thrusters), high thrust density and design simplicity. Their main drawback, especially when used at the micro-scale, is the very low efficiency and, consequently, extremely high required input power. They typically use the same type of propellants as ion thrusters, such as Xenon, Krypton, Iodine, Argon.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 23
			  hl-color:: red
			- Due to the mentioned down-scaling difficulties and high power requirements caused by the low efficiency, no Hall Effect thrusters are currently available at a scale that can be easily applied to small satellites such as CubeSats.

		- ## Electrospray Thrusters
		  collapsed:: true
			- Electrospray thrusters are based on electrostatic acceleration of charged ions from a liquid propellant to produce thrust. The propellant is a conductive liquid and its surface is deformed by a strong electric field into a sharp cone-shaped meniscus called Taylor Cone; when a certain electric potential threshold is reached, ions are extracted from the cone and then accelerated by the same electric field used for their extraction. Both positive and negative ions are accelerated, thus there is no need for an additional neutralizer as in ion thrusters. The propellants used by electrospray thrusters are usually ionic liquids, characterized by a very small vapour pressure that allows for avoiding propellant pressurization. Additionally, ionic liquids do not require heating, have low operating voltage and high conductivity. Typical propellants include liquid metals such as Cesium, Gallium and Indium, or solutions of Formamide, Propylene Carbonate, water, Tri-Ethylene Glycol doped with Sodium Iodide or other ionic salts.

		- ## Pulsed Plasma Thrusters
			- Pulsed Plasma Thrusters or PPT operate by creating a pulsed, high-current discharge across the exposed surface of a solid propellant (usually Teflon). The arc discharge, usually generated in a pulsed way by a spark plug, ablates the propellant material generating ionized molecules which are then accelerated. The current pulse usually has a duration of a few microseconds and is driven by a capacitor charged and discharged approximately once per second. A spring mechanism ensures that there is always a propellant surface which can be ablated close to the spark plug. The ablated propellant ions flow in a chamber between an anode and a cathode and, being conductive, close the electrical circuit generated by the voltage provided by a Power Processing Unit (PPU), thus allowing current to flow from the anode to the cathode. This current, in turn, produces a self-induced magnetic field, and the propellant ions are accelerated by a Lorentz force perpendicular to both the electric and the magnetic fields.

			- The main advantages of Pulsed Plasma Thrusters are their ability to provide very small impulse bits for precision maneuvers, simplicity due to the relatively small number of components, possibility of using a wide range of propellants (not only solid but also in the liquid state) and adjusting the thrust level by varying the pulse frequency, fast response time to commands. However, they also suffer from major drawbacks such as rapid erosion of the electrodes, presence of non-ionized macro-particles in the exhaust plume due to non-uniform ablation, relatively high dry mass due to the bulky electronics required for their operation, and very low efficiency (typically in the 10-15% range)

			- A particular class of PPTs are the so-called Vacuum Arc Thrusters, which are based on exactly the same principle, with the only difference that propellant ablation is obtained by a vacuum arc instead of a spark plug. In this case the ions to be accelerated are ablated directly from the cathode material (which is therefore, as a matter of fact, the propellant itself), allowing for higher efficiency.
