	- # Chapter 1
		- The thrust is simply the force produced by the rocket, which can be calculated using the following equation:
		  hl-page:: 7
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: yellow
		  \(F_T=\dot{m} \cdot v_e+\left(p_e-p_a\right) \cdot A_e=\dot{m} \cdot v_{e g}\)
		- In order to write the thrust equation in a more compact way, an equivalent jet velocity is usually defined, indicated by v eq in equation (1.1), which accounts for both the momentum and pressure terms in the equation.
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-page:: 7
		  hl-color:: yellow
		- For a negligible mass change:
		  \(\Delta P = F \cdot t\)
		  \(\Delta P = m \cdot \Delta V\)
		- The specific impulse is defined as the ratio of the total impulse generated by the rocket (thrust integrated over the burn time), to the total weight of propellant used to generate it.
		  hl-page:: 7
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: yellow
		  \(I_{s p}=\frac{\nu_{e q}}{g_0}\)
		- The Delta-V is the ideal velocity change experienced by the spacecraft in which the propulsion system is installed
		  hl-page:: 7
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: yellow
		  \(\Delta v=v_{e q}-\ln \left(\frac{M_0}{M_0-M_P}\right)\)
		- However, this is only true under a number of assumptions: no external forces acting on the spacecraft (such as gravity or atmospheric drag); equivalent jet velocity constant over time; propellant expelled in a direction exactly opposite to the flight direction. When at least one of these assumptions is not met, the Delta-V calculated by means of the rocket equation is no longer the actual velocity change of the spacecraft

		- it is important to find equations for three important parameters: the jet velocity, the mass flow rate and the propellant exhaust pressure. For systems based on thermal expansion of the propellant in a nozzle, simplified equations for these three parameters are provided by the so-called Ideal Rocket Theory. This theory is based on a number of simplifying assumptions for the flow in the nozzle, the most important of which are:
		  hl-page:: 8
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: red
		  hl-stamp:: 1683173847874
		  • The fluid flowing in the nozzle is a perfect, calorically ideal gas of constant homogeneous chemical composition;
		  • Flow is steady, isentropic, mono-dimensional, with purely axial velocity;
		  • No friction or other external forces act on the gas flowing in the nozzle. The nozzle is convergent-divergent, with an inlet section in which the flow is considered under stagnation conditions (negligible velocity), a throat section where the flow is sonic, and the exhaust section where the flow is typically highly supersonic.
		- Under the Ideal Rocket Theory assumptions, it is possible to derive the following equation for the jet velocity:
		  hl-page:: 8
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: red
		  \(v_e=\sqrt{\frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma-1} \cdot \frac{R_A}{M_W} \cdot T_C \cdot\left[1-\left(\frac{p_e}{p_C}\right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}\right]}\)
		  where \(p_C\) and \(T_C\) are the pressure and temperature at the nozzle inlet (which is the combustion chamber, in chemical engines), \(R_A\) is the universal gas constant (= 8314 J/K*kmol), \(M_W\) and \(\gamma\) are the molecular mass and specific heat ratio of the gas flowing in the nozzle. This equation shows that higher jet velocity (thus, higher specific impulse) can be achieved by selecting a propellant that allows for higher chamber temperature and lower molecular mass of the gas flowing in the nozzle
		- The specific heat ratio of a gas, often denoted by the symbol γ (gamma), is the ratio of its specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume. It is a dimensionless quantity and is an important parameter in thermodynamics. For an ideal gas, the value of γ is constant and is equal to 1.4. However, for real gases, the value of γ can vary slightly with temperature and pressure.
		- For the mass flow rate, the following equation holds:
		  hl-page:: 8
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: red
		  \(\dot{m}=\frac{p_C \cdot A^*}{\sqrt{\frac{R_A}{M_W} \cdot T_C}} \cdot \sqrt{\gamma \cdot\left(\frac{1+\gamma}{2}\right)^{\frac{1+\gamma}{1-\gamma}}}\)
		  where $A^*$ is the nozzle throat area.
		- Finally, the following relationship holds between the area ratio Ae /A* and the pressure ratio p_C /p_e :
		  hl-page:: 8
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: red
		  \(\frac{A_{\varepsilon}}{A^*}=\frac{\sqrt{\gamma \cdot\left(\frac{1+\gamma}{2}\right)^{\frac{1+\gamma}{1-\gamma}}}}{\sqrt{\frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma-1} \cdot\left(\frac{p_{\varepsilon}}{p_C}\right)^{\frac{2}{\gamma}} \cdot\left[1-\left(\frac{p_{\varepsilon}}{p_C}\right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}\right]}}\)

		- A good indication of the parameters that play a major role in influencing the performance can however be obtained looking at the ideal equations for an ion thruster, where an electrostatic field between two grids is used to accelerate charged particles and generate the thrust
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-page:: 9
		  hl-color:: green
		- A simplified equation for the jet velocity of the expelled ions can be written under the assumptions that only single-charged ions are present in the flow and that the kinetic energy acquired by an ion is exactly equal to the energy provided by the electrostatic field by which it is accelerated.

		- The specific impulse of an ion thruster can be calculated as:
		  hl-page:: 9
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: green
		  \(I_{s p}=\eta_{ion} \cdot \frac{v_e}{g_0}=\frac{\eta_{i o n}}{g_0} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2 e N_A V}{M_W}}\)
		  where \(\eta_{ion}\) is the ionization efficiency, which accounts for the fact that not all propellant atoms are ionized and contribute in an effective way to generate thrust, and has a typical value in the order of 0.7-0.9 in most ion thrusters.
		- Finally, the thruster efficiency (ratio of kinetic power in the exhaust jet to input power provided to the thruster by the power plant) can be written as:
		  hl-page:: 9
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: green
		  \(\eta=\frac{\frac{1}{2} \frac{M_W}{N_A} v_e^2}{\frac{1}{2} \frac{M_W}{N_A} v_e^2+e_I+e_L}\)
		  Where \(e_I\) is the ionization potential (energy needed for ionizing one atom of propellant) and \(e_L\) is a term which accounts for all other energy losses in the system.
		- Differently to propulsion systems where the propellant is accelerated in a nozzle, the ideal propellant for an ion thruster is a fluid with high molecular mass and low ionization potential. In this way, less energy is needed to ionize a heavier atom and, thus, to produce a higher mass flow rate of ions.

		- The “discharge coefficient” is defined here as the ratio of the actual measured (or calculated) mass flow rate to the nominal one obtained by means of the Ideal Rocket Theory; thus, a low discharge coefficient indicates the presence of significant losses in the nozzle flow.

		- Besides the significant uncertainty in the experimental results, reported by the author to be caused by a combination of uncertainty of measurements and inaccuracy of micro-nozzle manufacturing, the plots in Figure 2 clearly show a dramatic decrease in nozzle performance starting at a throat Reynolds number in the range 500-1000. The reason behind this performance drop is not fully understood yet, but is believed to be related to the thick boundary layer at the nozzle throat caused by the laminar flow, which in turns makes the effective throat area smaller and the mass flow rate lower than the ideal one. This also makes the expansion in the nozzle divergent less effective due to the separation effects, with a worst case in which no expansion at all occurs when the flow separation becomes large enough. It is therefore expected that conventional nozzle shapes would not work properly at a throat Reynolds number lower than 1000, for which different types of nozzle shapes would need to be considered.

		- Recent research conducted at TU Delft has shown that for this range of very low throat Reynolds number, aerospike micro-nozzles (i.e., nozzles with the flow expanding around a central solid body, instead of being bounded by external walls) can allow for a performance improvement up to 33% when compared to conventional convergent-divergent ones.

		- The general scaling rules for micropropulsion systems are:
		  \(F_T=\dot{m} \cdot v_e \propto p_C A^* \propto p_C\left(d^*\right)^2\)
		- In a similar way, for the throat Reynolds number as defined in equation (1.11), it is possible to show that:
		  hl-page:: 11
		  ls-type:: annotation
		  hl-color:: blue
		  \(R e^*=\frac{a \cdot d^*}{\nu} \propto p_c \cdot d^*\)
		  where a is the speed of sound and \(\nu\) the kinematic viscosity of the gas flowing in the nozzle (evaluated at throat conditions in terms of pressure and temperature), and \(d^*\) is the throat diameter.
		- Another set of important down-scaling issues come from the variations of heat transfer mechanisms with size.
		  hl-page:: 11
		  ls-type:: annotation

		  Heat transfer by conduction becomes much more effective in micropropulsion systems because, for the same material and the same thermal conductivity, smaller size leads to smaller temperature gradients and, thus, a significantly more uniform temperature in the whole thruster. This may represent an issue especially in thrusters where high temperatures are expected, such as chemical propulsion systems, where a large amount of heat power needs to be released by a smaller volume and, thus, the thermal stresses in the material are amplified.

		- Finally, in propulsion systems where a chemical reaction takes place in the combustion chamber, the effectiveness of the chemical reaction strongly depends on the residence time of the propellants in the chamber and on the so-called characteristic length, a design parameter defined as the ratio of the chamber volume to the nozzle throat area. For a given combination of propellants, there is always a (fixed) optimum range of characteristic length values in order to achieve efficient combustion. Considering that the ratio of combustion chamber area to throat area is not expected to change significantly when going from macro- to micro-scale, this means that the combustion chamber length should be kept constant for any size of the system, which is obviously not practical when all other dimensions are reduced by several orders of magnitude.

		- ## Cold Gas Systems
		  collapsed:: true
			- In cold gas systems, the propellant is stored at high pressure (usually in its liquid phase to allow for higher density and therefore reduced volume, but in principle it can also be stored in the gaseous phase) and accelerated in a nozzle without any additional heating or energy input. If the propellant is stored as a liquid, it is vaporized before reaching the nozzle.
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-page:: 14
			  hl-color:: yellow
			- In micro-thrusters typically the pressure regulator is not present due to mass and volume limitations (in particular when the propellant is stored in the gaseous phase), and the only required power is to activate the valve and keep it open when needed.
			  hl-page:: 14
			  ls-type:: annotation
			  hl-color:: yellow
			- In absence of the pressure regulator, the gaseous propellant storage pressure in the tank continuously decreases while propellant is extracted from it (blow-down operation)
			  hl-page:: 14

			  hl-page:: 15
			  ls-type:: annotation

		- ## Mono-Propellant Systems
		  collapsed:: true
			- In mono-propellant systems, the propellant is typically stored in its liquid phase and pressurized by a pressurant gas which is usually stored separately, with a pressure regulator between the two tanks in order to ensure for constant nozzle inlet pressure and, therefore, constant thrust. By opening the thrust valve, the propellant is then flown into the decomposition chamber, where it chemically decomposes into simpler molecules generating heat and, therefore, entering the nozzle inlet at high temperature. Decomposition is usually facilitated by a catalyst, but also requires in most cases pre-heating of the propellant which, in turn, requires a non-negligible amount of satellite power.

Two thrust valves are present in this case, through which the propellants flow into the combustion chamber, where a chemical reaction between fuel and oxidizer generates heat and allows them to enter the nozzle inlet at high temperature.

			- Since the propellant is accelerated in a nozzle, equation (1.5) for the mass flow rate is still valid; however, for the most common case of a liquid propellant that needs to be vaporized before being accelerated in the nozzle, it has to be combined with the following relationship that characterizes the vaporization and heating of the propellant: \(P_h=\dot{m} \cdot\left[c_{p L} \cdot\left(T_{b o i l}-T_0\right)+L_h+c_{p G} \cdot\left(T_C-T_{\text {boil }}\right)\right]\)

The ions are then accelerated by two grids between which a potential drop is applied.

		- ## Hall Effect Thrusters
		  collapsed:: true
			- in Hall Effect thrusters, thrust is generated by first ionizing and then accelerating the propellant. However, in this case, a different acceleration mechanism is used, based on mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields applied to the ionization chamber. As in ion thrusters, electrons are injected in the ionization chamber. As a consequence of the Hall effect, they start moving in a spiral trajectory with velocity perpendicular to both the magnetic field B and the electric field E. Ionization of the propellant, as usual, is obtained through collisions between these electrons and the propellant molecules, and propellant ions are then accelerated by the applied electric field. Therefore, no grids are needed in this case to accelerate the propellant, and they are replaced in practice by the applied magnetic field which, in a typical Hall Effect thruster, is radial.

		- ## Electrospray Thrusters
		  collapsed:: true
			- Electrospray thrusters are based on electrostatic acceleration of charged ions from a liquid propellant to produce thrust. The propellant is a conductive liquid and its surface is deformed by a strong electric field into a sharp cone-shaped meniscus called Taylor Cone; when a certain electric potential threshold is reached, ions are extracted from the cone and then accelerated by the same electric field used for their extraction. Both positive and negative ions are accelerated, thus there is no need for an additional neutralizer as in ion thrusters. The propellants used by electrospray thrusters are usually ionic liquids, characterized by a very small vapour pressure that allows for avoiding propellant pressurization. Additionally, ionic liquids do not require heating, have low operating voltage and high conductivity. Typical propellants include liquid metals such as Cesium, Gallium and Indium, or solutions of Formamide, Propylene Carbonate, water, Tri-Ethylene Glycol doped with Sodium Iodide or other ionic salts.

		- ## Pulsed Plasma Thrusters
		  collapsed:: true
			- Pulsed Plasma Thrusters or PPT operate by creating a pulsed, high-current discharge across the exposed surface of a solid propellant (usually Teflon). The arc discharge, usually generated in a pulsed way by a spark plug, ablates the propellant material generating ionized molecules which are then accelerated. The current pulse usually has a duration of a few microseconds and is driven by a capacitor charged and discharged approximately once per second. A spring mechanism ensures that there is always a propellant surface which can be ablated close to the spark plug. The ablated propellant ions flow in a chamber between an anode and a cathode and, being conductive, close the electrical circuit generated by the voltage provided by a Power Processing Unit (PPU), thus allowing current to flow from the anode to the cathode. This current, in turn, produces a self-induced magnetic field, and the propellant ions are accelerated by a Lorentz force perpendicular to both the electric and the magnetic fields.

However, they also suffer from major drawbacks such as rapid erosion of the electrodes, presence of non-ionized macro-particles in the exhaust plume due to non-uniform ablation, relatively high dry mass due to the bulky electronics required for their operation, and very low efficiency (typically in the 10-15% range)

						- Thrust increases by two orders of magnitude.
			- ### Specific Impulse-Power
			  collapsed:: true
				- the specific impulse would be expected to be proportional to the square root of the power or, in other words, a “100/10” slope in the logarithmic chart of Figure 24. However, in the figure, this trend seems to be followed only by electrospray thrusters, with most of the other propulsion types showing very weak or even no clear relationship between specific impulse and power
				  ls-type:: annotation
				  hl-page:: 28
				  hl-color:: yellow
				- it is likely that a certain type of electric propulsion is preferred to always work in a given specific impulse range independently on the amount of input power required. This is probably a consequence of general efficiency considerations given that, in electric propulsion, the thruster efficiency is usually a direct function of the specific impulse and it is typically possible to find a specific impulse value for which efficiency is maximum.

			- ### Thrust-Power Ratio
			  collapsed:: true
				- As already anticipated by the thrust-power chart, resistojets offer a significantly higher thrust/power ratio than any other systems
				  ls-type:: annotation
				  hl-page:: 28
				  hl-color:: yellow
				- resistojets are an optimal solution when a thrust in the order of a few mN is required with an available input power in the order of a few W (as it typically happens in CubeSats or other similar small satellites).
				  ls-type:: annotation
				  hl-page:: 28
				  hl-color:: yellow
				- The second best option in terms of thrust/power ratio are Hall Effect thrusters (0.03-0.1 mN/W), but they are typically characterized by a thrust level in the order of 6 mN or higher which, combined to their thrust/power ratio range of values, leads to an input power of 100 W or higher, which is typically not compatible to the requirements of small satellites.
				  ls-type:: annotation
				  hl-page:: 28
				  hl-color:: yellow
				- All other options approximately cover the region below 0.05 mN/W, with just a few exceptions for some specific products.

			- ### Dry Mass
			  collapsed:: true
				- Looking at the dry mass as a function of thrust, a clearly increasing trend (higher dry mass with increasing thrust) can be observed for thrust levels up to 10 mN, while dry mass values tend to stay approximately constant for thrust levels higher than 10 mN. This can be explained by the fact that only cold gas or chemical propulsion systems are present in the thrust range of 10 mN or higher (with the only exception of Hall Effect thrusters). These systems are all based on accelerating the propellant in a nozzle: the thrust is proportional to chamber pressure and nozzle throat area; however, in micro-propulsion systems, the chamber pressure is typically low and the nozzle is normally very small, meaning that changing their values to modify the thrust level does not affect the mass of the whole system in a significant way.

				  ls-type:: annotation
				  hl-color:: yellow
				  
				  Conversely, no clear trends can be observed in the dry mass as a function of the specific impulse. A slightly increasing trend seems to be present in the dry mass as a function of the input power, which can be explained by observing that systems requiring a higher power will typically also require more complex and heavier power management and conditioning components.
