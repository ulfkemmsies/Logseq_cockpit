- The thrust is the force generated by the gas accelerated and expelled through the nozzle. \(F=\dot{m} V_e+\left(p_e-p_a\right) A_e\)

- The exhaust velocity can be calculated by where Me is the Mach number at the exit, k is the ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure and constant volume, T1 is the chamber temperature, and R is the specific gas constant. \(V_e=M_e \sqrt{k R T_1}\)

- The mass flow rate can be written as a function of the chamber(stagnation) pressure and temperature (p1 and T1 ) and the area of the throat $$A_t$$: \(\dot{m}=A_t p_1 k \frac{\sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{k+1}\right)^{\frac{k+1}{k-1}}}}{\sqrt{k R T_1}}\)

  \(\frac{A_e}{A_t}=\left(\frac{k+1}{2}\right)^{-\frac{k+1}{2(k-1)}} M_e^{-1}\left(1+\frac{k-1}{2} M_e^2\right)^{\frac{k+1}{2(k-1)}}\)
  \(T_e=T_1\left(1+\frac{(k-1)}{2} M_e^2\right)^{-1}\)
  \(p_e=p_1\left(1+\frac{(k-1)}{2} M_e^2\right)^{\frac{-k}{k-1}}\)
- 2.2. Temperature dependent resistivity The resistance of the heaters depends on the temperature and might be approximated by the following linear relation:

- he total resistance of each heater should be according to the following equation:

  \(R=R_{s h} \frac{L}{W}\)
  where R is the resistance, Rsh is the sheet resistance, L is the length of the resistance, and W is the width of the resistance.
- The power P necessary to heat-up the water from room temperature of about 24 C to boiling point and vaporize it is calculated according to the following equation:

  \(P=\dot{m} \Delta H\) 
  where \(\Delta H=H_V-H_L, H_V\) is the enthalpy of water vapor at boiling temperature, and \(H_L\) is the enthalpy of liquid water at room temperature.
- This approach provides an acceptable estimation of the temperature, given the assumption that the whole thruster is at the same temperature.

- The performance of micropropulsion systems can generally be analyzed using the same formulation as in normal sized systems. However, it is important to note that this formulation uses a set of assumptions that might not be applicable to micropropulsion systems as, for example, the assumption of negligible friction forces[16]. Thus, the following set of equations are used only to give insights into the ideal performance of such micropropulsion systems.

- As the devices are very small and made of silicon which is good thermal conductor, a zero gradient of temperature might be assumed for the device. Therefore we can estimate that the temperature of the whole device is the same as the one estimated for the heaters. This approach has also been used to characterize similar devices made of molybdenum

- As the last step of the manufacturing is the isotropic etching, we can assume that the roughness of all the surfaces (including the nozzle throat) is similar to the measured roughness of the sample.
