When at least one of these assumptions is not met, the Delta-V calculated by means of the rocket equation is no longer the actual velocity change of the spacecraft

	- it is important to find equations for three important parameters: the jet velocity, the mass flow rate and the propellant exhaust pressure. For systems based on thermal expansion of the propellant in a nozzle, simplified equations for these three parameters are provided by the so-called Ideal Rocket Theory. This theory is based on a number of simplifying assumptions for the flow in the nozzle, the most important of which are:

	  • The fluid flowing in the nozzle is a perfect, calorically ideal gas of constant homogeneous chemical composition;
	  • Flow is steady, isentropic, mono-dimensional, with purely axial velocity;
	  • No friction or other external forces act on the gas flowing in the nozzle. The nozzle is convergent-divergent, with an inlet section in which the flow is considered under stagnation conditions (negligible velocity), a throat section where the flow is sonic, and the exhaust section where the flow is typically highly supersonic.

	- The specific heat ratio of a gas, often denoted by the symbol γ (gamma), is the ratio of its specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume. It is a dimensionless quantity and is an important parameter in thermodynamics. For an ideal gas, the value of γ is constant and is equal to 1.4. However, for real gases, the value of γ can vary slightly with temperature and pressure.
	- where pC and TC are the pressure and temperature at the nozzle inlet (which is the combustion chamber, in chemical engines), RA is the universal gas constant (= 8314 J/K*kmol), M W andγ are the molecular mass and specific heat ratio of the gas flowing in the nozzle. Equation (1.4) shows that higher jet velocity (thus, higher specific impulse) can be achieved by selecting a propellant that allows for higher chamber temperature and lower molecular mass of the gas flowing in the nozzle

	- ifferently to propulsion systems where the propellant is accelerated in a nozzle, the ideal propellant for an ion thruster is a fluid with high molecular mass and low ionization potential.

	- Besides the significant uncertainty in the experimental results, reported by the author to be caused by a combination of uncertainty of measurements and inaccuracy of micro-nozzle manufacturing, the plots in Figure 2 clearly show a dramatic decrease in nozzle performance starting at a throat Reynolds number in the range 500-1000. The reason behind this performance drop is not fully understood yet, but is believed to be related to the thick boundary layer at the nozzle throat caused by the laminar flow, which in turns makes the effective throat area smaller and the mass flow rate lower than the ideal one, see equation(1.5). This also makes the expansion in the nozzle divergent less effective due to the separation effects, with a worst case in which no expansion at all occurs when the flow separation becomes large enough. It is therefore expected that conventional nozzle shapes would not work properly at a throat Reynolds number lower than 1000, for which different types of nozzle shapes would need to be considered.

	- Recent research conducted at TU Delft [18] has shown that for this range of very low throat Reynolds number, aerospike micro-nozzles (i.e., nozzles with the flow expanding around a central solid body, instead of being bounded by external walls) can allow for a performance improvement up to 33% when compared to conventional convergent-divergent ones.

	- Heat transfer by conduction becomes much more effective in micropropulsion systems because, for the same material and the same thermal conductivity, smaller size leads to smaller temperature gradients and, thus, a significantly more uniform temperature in the whole thruster. This may represent an issue especially in thrusters where high temperatures are expected, such as chemical propulsion systems, where a large amount of heat power needs to be released by a smaller volume and, thus, the thermal stresses in the material are amplified.

	- Finally, in propulsion systems where a chemical reaction takes place in the combustion chamber, the effectiveness of the chemical reaction strongly depends on the residence time of the propellants in the chamber and on the so-called characteristic length, a design parameter defined as the ratio of the chamber volume to the nozzle throat area. For a given combination of propellants, there is always a (fixed) optimum range of characteristic length values in order to achieve efficient combustion. Considering that the ratio of combustion chamber area to throat area is not expected to change significantly when going from macro- to micro-scale, this means that the combustion chamber length should be kept constant for any size of the system, which is obviously not practical when all other dimensions are reduced by several orders of magnitude.

	- ### Thrust-Specific Impulse
	  collapsed:: true
		- All pure electric propulsion options can be found in the region of high specific impulse(typically 500 s or higher) and low thrust (typically a few mN or lower, with the only notable exception of Hall Effect and ion thrusters). Cold gas and resistojets allow for a wider range of thrust levels (from 0.1 mN to 0.1 N) but are typically limited to specific impulse values lower than 100 s. Chemical propulsion options are the only ones which allow for a thrust level higher than 0.1 N, but are confined to a narrow specific impulse range between 200 and 300 s.

	  collapsed:: true
		- As indirectly suggested by equation (1.10) in Chapter 2, the input power of an ion thruster is proportional, at least in a first simplified approximation, to the jet velocity squared v e2 . Looking at equation (1.7), this means that the input power is proportional to the grid voltage V and thus, from equation (1.8), the thrust is proportional to the input power squared

	  collapsed:: true
		- the specific impulse would be expected to be proportional to the square root of the power or, in other words, a “100/10” slope in the logarithmic chart of Figure 24. However, in the figure, this trend seems to be followed only by electrospray thrusters, with most of the other propulsion types showing very weak or even no clear relationship between specific impulse and power

		- it is likely that a certain type of electric propulsion is preferred to always work in a given specific impulse range independently on the amount of input power required. This is probably a consequence of general efficiency considerations given that, in electric propulsion, the thruster efficiency is usually a direct function of the specific impulse and it is typically possible to find a specific impulse value for which efficiency is maximum.

	- ### Dry Mass
	  collapsed:: true
		- Looking at the dry mass as a function of thrust, a clearly increasing trend (higher dry mass with increasing thrust) can be observed for thrust levels up to 10 mN, while dry mass values tend to stay approximately constant for thrust levels higher than 10 mN. This can be explained by the fact that only cold gas or chemical propulsion systems are present in the thrust range of 10 mN or higher (with the only exception of Hall Effect thrusters). These systems are all based on accelerating the propellant in a nozzle: by combining equations (1.1), (1.4) and (1.5) from previous Chapter, it can be seen that the thrust is proportional to chamber pressure and nozzle throat area; however, in micro-propulsion systems, the chamber pressure is typically low and the nozzle is normally very small, meaning that changing their values to modify the thrust level does not affect the mass of the whole system in a significant way.
