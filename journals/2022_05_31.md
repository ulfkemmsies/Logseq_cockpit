	- Collapse of China and Russia as space powers?
	- In case of hot conflict born of desperation, possible use of anti-satellite tech as MAD assurance from Russia against NATO?
	- Where do the resources used in the main sectors of space come from?
		- Inspect at every level of added value
			- Low: metal, silicon, energy, etc.
			- Mid: composite precursors
			- High: microchips, finished parts
	- How will breakdown of supply chains affect local manufacturing capabilities for each space power?
	- What might happen to international accords in exploration and development?
		- Artemis
		- ISS
