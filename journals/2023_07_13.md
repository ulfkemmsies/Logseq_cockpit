	- 08:00 I have been out of bed since 5:30, but basically awake all night due my last bump of 4MMC being at around 10 PM... clearly, that is much too late, as I lay in bed with a pounding heart, sweating bullets. I reek, but do not feel too tired (although I of course did more in the last 3 hours). 
	  
	  There is a specific feeling I am currently in the throes of that I find unique: it would best be described as feed exhaustion. The automatic behaviors of going on the 4 or 5 different information feeds and just scrolling have been exhausted, since they no longer feel fun or even worth it (I felt this strongest with 4chan). It is possible that the fatigue is just a result of my physical condition, but I have felt this way towards my phone recently... a strong need to distance myself from the gaping maw of the time sink that is "scrolling". I thought it would never catch up to me, as it did to many of my friends growing up. I looked down on them in disdain, but it was only a matter of time before I too succumbed. I need to finish the job I started last year and heavily limit/curate the information I read online, limiting myself to high quality, preferably personal/indy, and nothing sensationalized like doom porn, non-essential news, or memes. One could argue that it is important to keep up with the news in order to understand one's place on the stage, but there is a limit after which there is no added value in hearing about the millionth tragedy - I want to get off the news cycle train.
	  
	  I literally stared at my computer and did not know what to do, so I started uninstalling unused programs. I think I should really carve out some mental space for writing and music, since otherwise I will literally just be thinking about work all day long. Work and distractions, that is.
	  
	  At risk of repeating myself, these journal entries are the only place where I actually feel fully connected
