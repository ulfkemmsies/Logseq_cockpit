- 19:41 Still riding the bus on the way to SÃ£o Paulo. Some massive traffic jam stretching many kilometers held us up for hours on end. Might as well do some writing while bored and disconnected from the internet. In a sense, it actually feels refreshing to still have access to technology without the promises of endless mindless entertainment - all the tools without the distraction. Maybe I should just download the documentation for all the main libraries I use so I can code without being online.
