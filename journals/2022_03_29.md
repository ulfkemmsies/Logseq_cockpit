		- ## Morning
			- ### I am grateful for:
				- 1. My parents that raised me to the best of their ability
				- 2. No one in my family having a serious medical condition (currently)
				- 3. The many opportunities life gives us to check our egos and re-learn humility
			- ### What would make today great?
				- 1. Getting some results from the AI
				- 2. Finishing and shipping the presentation
				- 3. Making a list of arguments for me not to go to Curitiba
			- ### Daily Affirmation - I am...
				- Not special, not endowed, nothing more than the result of my work.

- 07:16 Got out of shower, logging on Logseq. Woke up at 4:45 on the dot without an alarm - success. Now to move on to 4:30
	- The only two things I am doing today is implementing this time series classifier, and making the presentation. Nothing more.
