		- For some reason, BÃ¡rbara was in an underwater dream with heavy sexual undertones....
		- What Peterson says about treating yourself badly: due to no one else better knowing all the reasons to hate you than yourself, all your faults and wrongdoings, specially the ones that never leave the confines of your mind. I definitely feel that way, and should remember to treat myself like I would treat another simply because I have a responsibility to those around me to do my best to make their lives better.

		- ## Morning
			- ### I am grateful for:
				- 1. Having discovered what the main drivers for the circadian rhythm are
				- 2. Having met all the incredible people I met in Delft
				- 3. Having a girlfriend who loves me as much as Aster does
			- ### What would make today great?
				- 1. Getting all the things done I wanted to get done, so I can start Monday with a clean slate
				- 2. Actually staying away from pr0nz
				- 3. Keeping food, sugar and snacking to a minimum (specially near night-time!)
			- ### Daily Affirmation - I am...
				- Not fully my own property, but belong to God, for there is a divine spark inside me.
		- ## Evening
			- ### 3 amazing things that happened today:
				- 1.
