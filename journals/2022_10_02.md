	- 09:51 Despite getting a late start today, I am feeling confident. Sadly I'll be missing out on going to Leiden with Dan Stutman, but some good work needs to get done today. Later, I will have to circle back to hash out some of the things on my mind - my mental health is not doing too well, and if I don't find a serious remedy for it, I will simply not be able to accomplish what I have set out for this year.
	- Dustin mentioned that a realistic timeline for having the plutogravitas idea set up and ready to invest in is actually the time of my graduation, which greatly takes off any pressure to get as much of it done as possible now. As always, slow and steady is the way to go.
