	- 03:55-04:30 Woke up after some crazy fucking dreams concerning gory violence, and later, Dante and I talking about revelling in having done nothing vs. building something over your life. Could not fall asleep again due to racing mind, for some reason, and almost considered just staying awake and starting the day then. Eventually fell back asleep.
	- 06:30-07:00 Snoozing with alarm, quite drowsy due to the broken sleep
	- 07:05-07:25 Realized today was egg market day and that I had to beat the Dutch grannies to it. Got dressed and ran over in my flip flops, managed to bag 60 double-yolk eggs and two burratas.
