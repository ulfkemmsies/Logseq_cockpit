	- 14:59 I have been procrastinating for the past 3 days and am not sure why. Am I afraid of doing the work for my internship? Am I just too lazy? Have I been sucked into the vortex of doomscrolling on X and Reddit, entering the race for attention and validation that is sucking me of my ability to live in the real world?
	  
	  I think I need to take a step back and focus on producing much more than I consume. I am simply wasting enormous amounts of time of my life on this business.
