- Doing #lecturenotes for [[Nonlinear Differential Equations]]
	- Fundamental Matrix
		- Plug in $t=0$, becomes Identity Matrix
	- Equivalent Integral Equation
		- Estimating error orders for approximations
		-
	- Method of Variation of Constants
	- Naive Perturbation Expansion
	- Gronwall's Inequality
	- Autonomous Equations
		- Equilibrium Points
			- Translation property: if $\phi (t)$ is a solution for $\dot{x} (t) = f(x(t))$ then $\phi (t-t_0)$ is also a solution
		- Periodic Solutions
		- Integral Manifolds
	- The norm of the sum is larger than the sum of the norms
