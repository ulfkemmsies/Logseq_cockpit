	- 08:17 I feel dead inside, or stuck at the very least. It feels like there is no animating force left to drive me forwards, I am am just waiting for time to pass in order to dull the pain. What am I running from? Where does this cowardice stem from? I run towards the embrace of my phone, happily getting lost in the words of others and opinions of anonymous strangers... anything to not be left alone with my thoughts. Nothing I do feels genuine anymore, and even the sources of struggle I give myself are playdates inside the pen, simulations of hardship. I should be out on the steppe, conquering my lessers, not watching them twerk on the remains of my home.
	  
	  A possibility is my fear of financial "ruin" and reputation damage with my parents in case BBBYQ goes wrong, and even though I have two levels of backup plan, I still feel the dread. My head feels empty, and I slightly mentally disabled for some reason.
	  
	  I would hate to accidentally mistake some biological shortcoming with an actual existential issue.
