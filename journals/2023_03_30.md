		- Morning. This is my daily log of speaking, of course. Sometimes I wonder who exactly it is I'm addressing when I'm doing these because, you know, it's the tone that you speak in, rather the person that you're speaking to. Is it you or me? Is it us? Is there a distinction between the you that is being addressed and these logs and the me that's speaking? There's often this duality within my very thought process. So yeah, I think there's stuff. Excuse me. Oh boy. Big yawns. It's definitely interesting to consider who it is that that I'm addressing and why, of course. So maybe it's the superego talking in these logs or maybe it's a superego listening. I don't really know. I haven't thought enough about this. Yeah, I think last night I had a pretty wild dream about some sort of a video game that was programmable and you could program it to do stuff remotely and then come back and stuff would have happened inside and it was a very realistic dream. It was multilayered and interestingly these glycine dreams that I've had recently, they've just been very multilayered. Lots of, you know, waking up in the dream and being in a higher level of consciousness or realizing that you were in a dream. I was expecting more, let's say, esoteric dreams but these are just very, very lifelike, which is interesting because it means you can actually practice real-life skills. So I guess maybe Solbrah was not wrong about this. Maybe I should practice that or, you know, practice specific intent before going to sleep so that you end up dreaming about specific things. So yeah, oh, I just realized I didn't answer leave's audios yesterday night either so I should do that right after I finish this log here. And yeah, I think for today I'm just hoping to really manage to get the the whisper thing done because that's been a pain in the ass. Also because it's my conversation with Vin today, the one-on-one review session. Yeah, I mean I'm really hoping to get this raise soon because yeah, I mean otherwise I'm eating into savings every month and I only have about 2k left so that makes a difference. Yeah, yeah, in any case I think things are going alright. The other day I had a situation where I was trying to help Silvia not smoke and it's really sad to see how how he's doing but, you know, there's no more that I can do than what I am doing and I'm also not his father but clearly he seems quite bothered about the fact that he is seemingly wasting his parents money and I mean that's what his dad told him at least. And Christ, I mean being told that outright by your parents that must be difficult. I'm kind of glad. The reason I got cut off was because they couldn't pay for me anymore so yeah, it's probably more honorable anyway. Yeah, I think, boy, jeez, sometimes I'm afraid of being too pedestrian in these logs and only talking about, you know, operational stuff and everyday things and not really digging down deeper into the deeper inner life that I'm experiencing and I don't know why this is. Maybe these thoughts are something that you have to be primed for, that you have to be, yeah, all prompted for. Maybe they only occur in more pensive moments but maybe I should just practice making these smaller logs during the day. Yeah, just like I normally would if I had managed to make that log-seek plugin which I'm still trying to do because obviously that would be really fucking cool. Yeah, I suppose I can just try doing this more often during the day. Of course it will seem weird to us to her, for example, if she just hears me talking to myself and I won't really have as much privacy in that regard but hey, you know, let's take what you get. So yeah, I think yesterday evening I had another moment with the wind in the night air where it felt like I could feel out towards the universe and hear things in the night air that are not picked up by one's ears and I'm not quite sure what this is. I've had this several times when I was younger. There was one specific spot on Rua Justo Manfron which causes this one place where the wind weaves through the the fields just right and if you stop and listen at night it feels like God is speaking to you. I never knew exactly what caused this feeling because it really feels like being struck by some sort of lightning but it comes from inside and suddenly your entire perception shifts and you seem to have extra sensory perception and it just feels like you're much more connected to the inner structure of all other things like you can feel them with your senses and like you're one with them really and you know maybe that these are all just like flashbacks from my use of psychedelics but sometimes I really do wonder if it isn't and I guess that's just the fundamental human question right our sensory experiences really reflective of reality or are they just tricks that we play on ourselves you know leftovers of evolution and adaptability and so on I mean I remember reading that theory that space and time are really just simplified abstractions that help us move around because they're not actually fundamental constructs of reality so but yes I had this feeling actually a couple of times recently and it was mostly at night in the wind there must be some reason why I have this feeling specifically in those moments with the night wind but maybe it's the solitude maybe it's the maybe it's the darkness maybe it's the expectation or the potential who knows but yes very very nice moments difficult to have with other people though usually by myself yeah I think another another thing I have to remember is to just be more relaxed during these logs here I mean it's like I'm forcing myself to speak or stay on track stay on target speak smoothly so that the transcription comes out nicely but in truth I don't really owe anything to myself or to anyone in this regard I'm just doing this because I have to get the thoughts out and yeah I mean what else is there to do so I should just treat this like this little space that I have where I can you know relax kick back and just say whatever I want to and surely if I do this the thoughts will just come out more smoothly and I won't have to think about it as much anymore and perhaps it solves itself you know if I ever want to have a podcast one day this is exactly how it has to be I just have to speak freely and use as few verbal crutches and awkward pauses as possible just have it flow out like Bap does so yes I think I'm gonna cut it short here it's probably enough big thoughts for the day and I leave you or me us you sexy bastard I leave you with this parting thoughts which is don't get too caught up in work because there will be an infinite amount of work so signing off
