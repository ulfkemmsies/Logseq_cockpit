- Grain growth and the subsequent grain size coarsening signiÔ¨Åcantly affect magnetic domain mobility and is, therefore, a key factor in obtaining good magnetic properties for the soft magnetic Fe-Co-V alloy in this study. The structure-sensitive magnetic properties, e.g. coercivity and permeability, however, also depend on precipitate distribution and size, internal stresses, state of order, texture, imposed external stress and test temperature (Sundar and Deevi, 2005).

- The g 2 precipitates act as a pinning site for magnetic domains, which is important to consider when choosing the heat treatment, as obtaining good magnetic properties is a balance between grain size, number and size of precipitates and the order parameter. The state of order has an effect on the yield stress of Fe-Co-V, which is higher in the disordered state, but a high state of order is still preferred as it decreases the coercivity (Sundar and Deevi, 2005).

- he optimized process parameters led to high density, which is important in highperformance components because defects such as pores can hinder the movement of magnetic domains, thus weakening the magnetic properties. Most of the pores are small, with a diameter of 10-20 m m, and are likely induced by gas trapped inside the molten powder (Zhang et al., 2017).
