			- > If we assume that Scafetta‚Äôs estimate correct, figures 1 and 2 show that all climate model simulations (the green dots in figure 2) for the 21 climate models with ECS &gt;3¬∞C and the great majority of their simulation members (the black dots) are obviously too warm at a statistically significant level. Whereas, assuming Schmidt‚Äôs estimate correct, figure 2 suggests that three climate models with ECS&gt;3¬∞C partially fall within the ERA5 margin of error while the other 18 climate models run too hot.

			- > The essence of the dispute is how to compute the 95% uncertainty (the error estimate) of the 2011-2021 ERA5 weather reanalysis mean relative to the 1980-1990 period. This error estimate is used to decide whether a particular model result is within the margin of error of the observations (ERA5) or not. Scafetta computes a very small ERA5 error range of 0.01¬∞C (Scafetta N. , 2022b, Appendix) from similar products (HadCRUT5, for example) because ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather) provides no uncertainty estimate with their weather reanalysis product (ERA5), so it must be estimated. Schmidt computes a very large ERA5 margin of error of 0.1¬∞C using the ERA5 standard deviation for the period.

			- > Scafetta‚Äôs [original 2022 paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL097716) in _Geophysical Research Letters_ is the origin of the dispute (downloading a pdf is free). The essence of the paper is that CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) that produce an ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity) higher than 3¬∞C/2xCO2 (‚Äú¬∞C/2xCO2‚Äù means ¬∞C per doubling of CO2) are statistically significantly different (they run too hot) from observations since 1980.
