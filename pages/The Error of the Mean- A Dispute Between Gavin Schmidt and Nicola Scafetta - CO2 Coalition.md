			- > Scafetta‚Äôs [original 2022 paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL097716) in _Geophysical Research Letters_ is the origin of the dispute (downloading a pdf is free). The essence of the paper is that CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) that produce an ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity) higher than 3¬∞C/2xCO2 (‚Äú¬∞C/2xCO2‚Äù means ¬∞C per doubling of CO2) are statistically significantly different (they run too hot) from observations since 1980.

			  _Figure 1\. Plots of climate model results are shown in red and [ECMWF ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5) weather reanalysis observations are shown in blue. The top two plots show model runs that result in ECS calculations greater than 3¬∞C/2xCO2 and the lower plot those with ECS less than 3¬∞C/2xCO2.
