- Gross Sensitive Mass Term Definiton:
  $$\phi=\frac{(T / W)_{\text {vehicle-initial }}\left(1+\left(f_{T S W}\right)(T / W)_{\text {vac }}\right)}{(T / W)_{\text {engine-initial }}}$$

	- $(T / W)_{\text{vehicle-init, engine-init, vac }}$ : Thrust to weight ratio (at the beginning of the mission) of the entire vehicle, only the engine, and the engine in vacuum
	- $f_{TSW}$ : Thrust-structure factor
- Assuming vacuum and no thrust structure coefficient:
  $$\phi=\frac{(T / W)_{\text {vehicle-initial }}}{(T / W)_{\text {engine-initial }}}$$
- Given a known engine (thrust and mass) and atmospheric environment, a vehicle level thrust to mass ratio must be chosen. On a gravitational body, it will depend on how much thrust is usually needed (2:1 on the Moon, a bit more than 1 on Earth). In orbit, where the weight is zero, the relation only depends on masses since the g's cancel out.
