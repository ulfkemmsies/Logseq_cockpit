- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper presents a comprehensive approach for the modeling of micropropulsion systems based on the vaporization of a liquid. The model combines analytical and empirical relations derived from extensive experimental analysis and fundamental physical laws. This allows modeling of key parameters, such as mass ﬂow rate, for the entire system comprising a tank to store the liquid propellant, a valve to control the mass ﬂow, and a microthruster that vaporizes the propellant and accelerates it generating thrust. The model is evaluated by a sensitivity analysis considering the boundaries of the modeling space and it has been tested in a simulation loop demonstrating the attitude control of a nano-satellite using a set of four thrusters. The results of the simulation are used to test the developed model.
