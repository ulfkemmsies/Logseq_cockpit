- There are different kinds of responsibility that can be

  id:: 6376c0c5-bf9f-44e5-8dfa-a0c493026cfb
  distinguished. A common distinction is between active responsibility and passive
  responsibility. Active responsibility is responsibility before something has happened. It
  refers to a duty or task to care for certain state-of-affairs or persons. Passive responsi-
  bility is applicable after something (undesirable) has happened.
- **Role responsibility** The responsibility that is based on the role one has or plays in a certain situation.

- **Passive responsibility** Backward-looking responsibility, relevant after something undesirable occurred; specific forms are accountability, blameworthiness, and liability.

- You are not always blameworthy for

  the consequences of your actions or for your actions
  themselves. Usually, four conditions need to apply:
  wrong-doing, causal contribution, foreseeability,
  and freedom.
- Mark Bovens mentions the following features of active responsibility:

  ● Adequate perception of threatened violations of norms;
  ● Consideration of the consequences;
  ● Autonomy, i.e. the ability to make one’s own independent moral decisions;
  ● Displaying conduct that is based on a verifiable and consistent code; and
  ● Taking role obligations seriously. (Bovens, 1998)
- Tripartite model A model that
  ls-type:: annotation
  hl-page:: 35
  id:: 6376c348-93fa-4500-8d47-0874fe9026ec
  maintains that engineers can only be held
  responsible for the design of products
  and not for wider social consequences or
  concerns. In the tripartite model three
  separate segments are distinguished: the
  segment of politicians; the segment of
  engineers; and the segment of users.
- Collingridge dilemma This dilemma

  id:: 6376c60b-6f7f-48cb-8066-8fbf2fdc8f20
  refers to a double-bind problem to
  control the direction of technological
  development. On the one hand, it is
  often not possible to predict the
  consequences of new technologies
  already in the early phases of
  technological development. On the
  other hand, once the (negative)
  consequences materialize it often has
  become very difficult to change the
  direction of technological development.
