- Under the experimental conditions in this paper, the coating maximum width and the welding surplus height increase with the rise in welding HI and Pd, respectively. The coatingâ€™s Hc decreases whereas its Ms increases sharply with the growth in Dv, and the former increases but the latter decreases with the increasing welding HI.
