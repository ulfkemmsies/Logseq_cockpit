		  Malleable
		  Electrically conductive
		  Thermally conductive

		  collapsed:: true
			- Defects
				- 0-D: point defects (vacancies, interstitial atoms, substitutional, ...)
				- 1-D: line defects - dislocations (edge or screw), dislocation loops
				- 2-D: grain-boundaries, phase boundaries, stacking faults
				- 3-D: precipitates, voids \(\rightarrow\) not always considered as imperfections but as a part of materials microstructure.
			- Dislocations

				- Alloying elements interact with each other
				- Dislocations enhance diffusion rates of alloying elements
				- Heterogeneities can act as nucleation sites
				- Interface energies depend on local concentration of alloying element and crystallographic misorientation between grains
				- Microstructures are hierarchical in nature
				- Dislocations form networks in 3D
