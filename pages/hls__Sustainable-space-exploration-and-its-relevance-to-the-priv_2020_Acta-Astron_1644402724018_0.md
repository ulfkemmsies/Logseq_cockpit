For example, a convention inLucca, Italy, on November 10, 2011 concluded that the conspicuousbenefitsofspaceexplorationinclude:“Fueling future discoveries, addressing global challenges in spaceand on Earth through the use of innovative technology, creatingglobal partnerships by sharing challenging and peaceful goals, in-spiring society and especially the younger generations throughcollective and individual efforts and enabling economic expansionandnewbusinessopportunities”[76].
