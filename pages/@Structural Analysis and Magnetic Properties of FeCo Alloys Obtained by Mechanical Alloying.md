Elemental powders of Fe and Co mixed in an adequate weight ratio were milled at room temperature in a shaker mixer mill using vials and balls of hardened steel as milling media with a ball : powder weight ratio of 12 : 1. The mixtures were milled for 3 h. The results show that, after milling, for almost all the composition (up to

	                ), solid solutions based on bcc structures were obtained. For Co-rich alloys (

	                  ≥

	                ), different phases were found, revealing the formation of a metastable intermetallic phase (FeCo, wairauite) together with fcc-Co and hcp-Co phases. The specific saturation magnetization increases by increasing Co content, reaching a maximum value of 225 emu/g for hcp-Fe
