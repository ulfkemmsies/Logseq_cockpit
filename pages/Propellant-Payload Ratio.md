- Definition:
  $$\frac{m_{prop}}{m_{payload}} = \frac{1-(\phi+\lambda) \eta_{1} \eta_{2}+\lambda}{\eta_{1}\left(1+\epsilon \eta_{2}-\lambda\left(\eta_{2}-1\right)\right)} \cdot (1- \frac{1}{\eta_1 \eta_2}) - (1-\frac{1}{\eta_2})$$
- This is to be minimized for any trajectory.
- Negatively correlated with [[Gross-Sensitive Mass Term]].
	- Finding [[Thrust-to-Mass Ratio]] for orbital trajectories:
	  the initial ratio of the entire vehicle in vacuum is not possible because there is no minimum initial ratio to obey. There are some limitations:
		- Maneuver burn time is inversely proportional to [[Thrust-to-Mass Ratio]] due to:
		  $$
		  \Delta T=\frac{M_{L} E_{V}}{F}\left(1-e^{-\frac{\Delta V}{E_{V}}}\right)
		  $$
		  Burn time is important to keep as low as possible (but not too low) in order to maximize maneuver efficiency. Too much thrust removes controllability.
		- The cargo being carried creates the effective upper limit for the acceleration felt in the craft.
			- Human beings can tolerate up to around 6 g's of acceleration.
		- If the thrust of a given engine is known, the
		- Just choose the highest reasonable value that still makes the rocket work
