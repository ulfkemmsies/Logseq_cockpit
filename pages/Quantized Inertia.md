- The theory of QI was first proposed in 2007 by University of Plymouth physicist [Mike McCulloch](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/mike-mcculloch) as an alternative to the [Lambda Cold Dark Matter](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/graphic_history/univ_evol.html) (LCDM) model. This theory was an attempt to reconcile General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT) to explain the rotational curves of galaxies in a way that did not require Dark Matter (and as an explanation for the [Pioneer Anomaly](https://www.planetary.org/sci-tech/the-pioneer-anomaly)). The theory comes down to two essential elements:
- *According to GR, there is an event horizon in the Universe where light cannot reach an object because cosmic acceleration exceeds the speed of light. A similar horizon is produced if an object accelerates in one direction (known as a [Rindler horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rindler_coordinates#The_Rindler_horizon)). Anything beyond this is outside the observable Universe and cannot affect the object at the center of the “Rindler space.”*
- *According to QFT, similar radiation is predicted for an accelerating object ([Unruh radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unruh_effect#Unruh_radiation)). QI posits that Unruh radiation is the origin of inertia. Similar to the [Alcubierre Metric](https://www.universetoday.com/89074/what-is-the-alcubierre-warp-drive/) (but on a larger scale), the Rindler information horizon expands in the direction of acceleration and contracts behind it.*
