- In the probabilistic modelling of life-cycle management, the [[Renewal Theorem]] plays a key role in the computation of the expected number of renewals and the cost rate associated with a management strategy.

- To minimise the risk associated with failure of an infrastructure system, inspection and replacements are routinely carried out. Because of uncertainty associated with degradation mechanisms, operational loads and limited inspection data, probabilistic methods play a key role in developing cost effective management models

- For sake of conceptual simplicity, we consider a discrete time scale to model the process of times at which failure occurs with an independent, identically distributed (iid) sequence of 0â€“1 random variables, where 1 means occurrence of failure. This leads to a discrete version of the [[Poisson process]] where the times between failures are independent, geometrically distributed random variables.

- However, in cases where the geometric distribution of the inter-occurrence time cannot be justified, a natural way to generalise the analysis is to model it as a renewal process.

- The following recursion can be used to calculate the sequence as $u_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n} p_{k} u_{n-k} \quad\left(n \geq 1, u_{0}=1\right)$

	- This is an approximation of the convolution integral in [[../assets/Bednara_thesis_2008_-_Methds_for_approximating_the_availability_functions_1645798062058_0.pdf]]
- So, the basic idea is that the renewal rate can be directlyobtained from the generating function of the renewaldistribution. Then, it can be used to compute momentsof the number of renewals.
