	- ## Definition and explanation of MIG WAAM
		- ### Applications and use-cases of MIG WAAM in the industry
		- MIG WAAM stands for Metal Inert Gas Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing. It is a technique used in the fabrication of 3D metallic structures. WAAM is gaining popularity in the fabrication of 3D metal components, and MIG is one of the heat sources commonly used in WAAM. MIG is easier and more convenient than other heat sources like TIG and PAW because it uses a continuous wire spool with the welding torch.

		- [[@Comparison of Properties and Bead Geometry in MIG and CMT Single Layer Samples for WAAM Applications]]
		- 1. Arc Generation: The process begins with the generation of an electric arc between the wire electrode and the workpiece. This arc is hot enough to melt the wire electrode and part of the workpiece.
		- 2. Melting and Deposition: The melted wire, now in a liquid state, is then deposited onto the workpiece in a selective layered fashion.
		- 3. Solidification: Upon the solidification of the molten metal layer over a cold substrate, the subsequent thermal contraction of the metal layer generates tensile and compressive stresses respectively on the deposited layer and substrate.
		- 4. Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow: The heat transfer and fluid flow during this process play a crucial role in determining the final microstructure and mechanical properties of the deposited material.

- # Soft Magnetic Materials
	- Soft magnetic materials are materials that are easy to be magnetized and demagnetized.
	- ## Magnetic property definitions
		- ### Saturation magnetization
			- Saturation magnetization is a state reached in some magnetic materials when an increase in applied external magnetic field \((\mathrm{H})\) cannot increase the magnetization of the material further. This means that the total magnetic flux density (B) more or less levels off.
			  Magnetic materials are composed of tiny regions called domains, each of which has a magnetic moment that can align with an external magnetic field. When a magnetic material is magnetized by an external field, the domains tend to align with the field direction, resulting in an increase in the total magnetic flux density (B) of the material.
			- However, there is a limit to how much the magnetic flux density can increase with the applied field. Beyond this limit, the permeability of the material decreases sharply, and the magnetic flux density levels off or increases very slowly. This limit is called magnetic saturation.
			  Saturation magnetization corresponds to the maximum magnetic moment that can be obtained. It's the point at which the material obtains maximum alignment with the applied magnetic field. Different materials have different saturation levels. For example, high-permeability iron alloys used in transformers reach magnetic saturation at \(1.6-2.2\) teslas \((T)\), whereas ferrites saturate at \(0.2-0.5 \mathrm{~T}\).
		- ### Magnetic coercivity
		  collapsed:: true
			- Magnetic coercivity, also known as coercive force or coercive field, is a measure of the ability of a ferromagnetic material to withstand an external magnetic field without becoming demagnetized \({ }^1\). It is usually measured in oersted or ampere/meter units and is denoted \(\mathrm{Hc}\).
			  Coercivity in a magnetic material is the intensity of the applied magnetic field \((\mathrm{H}\) field) required to demagnetize that material, after the magnetization of the sample has been driven to saturation by a strong field \({ }^1\). This demagnetizing field is applied opposite to the original saturating field.
			  There are different definitions of coercivity, depending on what counts as 'demagnetized', thus the bare term "coercivity" may be ambiguous:
				- The normal coercivity, \(\mathrm{Hc_n}\), is the \(\mathrm{H}\) field required to reduce the magnetic flux (average \(\mathrm{B}\) field inside the material) to zero.
				- The intrinsic coercivity, \(\mathrm{Hc_i}\), is the \(\mathrm{H}\) field required to reduce the magnetization (average \(\mathrm{M}\) field inside the material) to zero.
				- The remanence coercivity, \(\mathrm{Hc_r}\), is the \(\mathrm{H}\) field required to reduce the remanence, also known as residual magnetism, which is the magnetization left behind in a ferromagnetic material after an external magnetic field is removed, to zero.
			- Ferromagnetic materials with high coercivity are called magnetically hard, and are used to make permanent magnets. Materials with low coercivity are said to be magnetically soft. The latter are used in transformer and inductor cores, recording heads, microwave devices, and magnetic shielding.
		- ### Maximum permeability
		  collapsed:: true
			- Magnetic permeability, typically represented by the Greek letter \(\mu\), is a measure of how a material responds to an applied magnetic field \({ }^1{ }^2\). It is defined as the ratio of the magnetic flux density (B) established within the material by a magnetizing field to the magnetic field strength \((H)\) of the magnetizing field \({ }^1\). In other words, it's the property of a material that indicates the degree to which a magnetic field can penetrate through it \({ }^3\).
			- In simple terms, magnetic permeability is the ability of a magnetic material to support magnetic field development \({ }^4\). It helps us measure a material's resistance to the magnetic field \({ }^3\).
			- The permeability of free space (also known as the magnetic constant or the permeability of vacuum) is a physical constant, denoted \(\mu_0\). The relative permeability \(\mu\) is then defined as the ratio \(\mu / \mu_0\), which is dimensionless \({ }^1\). Thus, the relative permeability of free space, or vacuum, is \(1^1\).
		- ### Power losses
		  collapsed:: true
			- Magnetic power losses, also known as iron losses, occur in the core of magnetic components such as transformers and inductors \({ }^1{ }^2\). These losses are related to the selection of the material used to make the core \({ }^1\). They are divided into two main types \({ }^2\) :
				- 1. Hysteresis Loss: This type of loss occurs when a magnetic material is subjected to a changing magnetic field. The magnetization of the material lags behind the changes in the magnetic field, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. The energy dissipated in this process is lost as heat \({ }^2\).
				- 2. Eddy Current Loss: This loss is due to the currents induced in the core by a changing magnetic field. These currents flow in closed loops within the plane of the core, producing heat. The magnitude of these losses depends on the square of the frequency, the thickness of the core laminations, and the square of the flux density \({ }^2\).
			- These losses are significant because they affect the efficiency of electromagnetic devices. Reducing these losses is a key goal in the design of such devices \({ }^1\).
		- ### Curie temperature
		  collapsed:: true
			- The Curie temperature, also known as the Curie point, is the temperature at which certain materials lose their permanent magnetic properties, which can (in most cases) be replaced by induced magnetism \({ }^1\)
			  This temperature is named after Pierre Curie, who showed that magnetism was lost at a critical temperature \({ }^1\). The force of magnetism is determined by the magnetic moment, a dipole moment within an atom which originates from the angular momentum and spin of electrons \({ }^1\).
			- Materials have different structures of intrinsic magnetic moments that depend on temperature; the Curie temperature is the critical point at which a material's intrinsic magnetic moments change direction \({ }^1\). Permanent magnetism is caused by the alignment of magnetic moments, and induced magnetism is created when disordered magnetic moments are forced to align in an applied magnetic field \({ }^1\).
			  For example, the ordered magnetic moments (ferromagnetic) change and become disordered (paramagnetic) at the Curie temperature \({ }^1\). Higher temperatures make magnets weaker, as spontaneous magnetism only occurs below the Curie temperature \({ }^1\).
	- ## Properties of soft magnetic materials
		- Soft magnetic materials have the following properties:
			- High saturation magnetization
			- Low coercivity
			- High initial/maximum permeability (Î¼max)
			- Low power losses
			- High Curie temperature
		- The microstructure of a material, such as grain size, crystallographic defects, crystallographic texture, and precipitates, can strongly affect its magnetic properties. The shape of the magnetic hysteresis loop, coercivity, and relative permeability are determined by both the intrinsic material properties and the microstructural characteristics. The arrangement of atoms in the material can also affect its magneto-crystalline anisotropy. To achieve softer magnetic behavior, it is necessary to obtain low magneto-crystalline anisotropy and higher lattice constant by increasing the structural ordering and having defect-free large equiaxed grains. The most appropriate manufacturing methods and thermal post-processing treatments should be chosen to achieve the desired microstructure and magnetic properties.
			- (Effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and magnetic properties of.pdf)
		- The microstructure of Fe-Co varies depending on the heat treatment. In the as-built condition, the microstructure has a fine grain structure with solidified grains oriented towards the center of the solidified melt track. Heat treatment at 820Â°C for 4 hours leads to a bimodal grain structure consisting of very small and large grains, indicating abnormal grain growth. Heat treatment consisting of a pre-anneal at 700Â°C followed by a 10-hour anneal at 820Â°C results in an equiaxed grain structure with relatively large grain size. A normalizing heat treatment is done to homogenize the microstructure prior to the primary heat treatment.

	- ## Uses and applications of soft magnetic materials
		- The growing demand for electricity and electronic devices drives the market for soft magnetic materials. They can be categorized based on composition and properties, with NiFe alloys being the softest magnetic materials available. These alloys exhibit high permeability, low coercivity, and relatively low saturation polarization. Soft magnetic materials find applications in electrical engineering and electronics, including transformers, generators, motors, and inductors. They are crucial for enhancing magnetic flux density in various devices, such as wireless charging systems, data storage devices, and sensors. Iron and iron-silicon alloys are the most widely used, occupying about 80% of the market. Fe-Si alloys with Si content below 9.5wt.% are commonly used in electric motor cores due to their desirable properties. These materials possess high electrical resistivity, low magnetostriction, and low magneto crystalline anisotropy. The demand for soft magnetic materials is increasing in the electronics and energy generation sectors, indicating a promising future for the market.
		  collapsed:: true
			- The most widely used soft magnetic material is iron-silicon alloy, also known as silicon steel, which accounts for about 80% of the soft magnetic materials market. It has high electrical resistivity, low magnetostriction, and low magneto crystalline anisotropy. The market for soft magnetic materials is driven by the increasing demand for electricity and electronic devices.
			- Soft magnetic materials can be classified into different groups based on their composition and properties. One such group is the NiFe alloys with 72-83% Ni, which are currently the softest magnetic materials available. These alloys have high initial and maximum permeability, low coercivity, and relatively low saturation polarization. The hysteresis loop shape of these alloys can also be varied over a wide range.
			- Soft magnetic materials have a wide range of applications in electrical engineering and electronics. They are used in devices such as transformers, generators, motors, and inductors. Soft magnetic materials are also used in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical power, as well as in electronic devices like wireless charging systems, data storage devices, and sensors. They are essential for enhancing the magnetic flux density generated by an electric current. Soft magnetic materials occupy about one-third of the total magnetic materials market, with iron and iron silicon alloys being the most widely used, accounting for about 80% of the soft magnetic materials market. Fe-Si alloys with Si content < 9.5wt.% are the main soft magnetic materials used in various types of electric motor cores due to their high electrical resistivity, low magnetostriction, and low magneto crystalline anisotropy. They are suitable for large-scale industrial applications. The demand for soft magnetic materials is increasing in the electronics and energy generation industries, and they are expected to play a significant role in the development of the soft magnetic materials market in the future.
	- ## Fe-Co alloys
		- One recent development in the field of soft magnetic materials is the creation of amorphous and nanocrystalline SMMs.
		  
		  Amorphous and nanocrystalline materials are preferred over normal soft magnetic alloys due to their superior magnetic properties and durability. They exhibit lower coercivity, higher permeability, and lower eddy current losses, making them more efficient for power electronics and electrical machines. Additionally, they have higher saturation magnetization, allowing for higher magnetic flux density and power density. They offer better thermal stability and corrosion resistance, enabling operation at higher temperatures and harsher environments.
		  
		  These materials also have lower magnetocrystalline anisotropy and longer magnetic correlation length, leading to less resistance to magnetization and domain wall movement. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy is a property of magnetic materials that describes the preferred direction of their magnetization. It is caused by the interaction between the magnetic moments of the atoms and the crystal lattice of the material. Different crystal orientations have different energies, and the lowest energy orientation determines the easy axis of magnetization. The magnetic correlation length in a metal is related to the extent to which a magnetic field generated by a current influences the surrounding region.
		  
		  Fe-Co alloys, depending on the manufacturing method, can be either amorphous or nanocrystalline.
		  
		  To differentiate the two novel material types: Amorphous materials haveÂ **no long-range atomic order**, while nanocrystalline materials haveÂ **small grains**Â of ordered atoms within a disordered matrix. Amorphous materials haveÂ **low magnetocrystalline anisotropy**Â andÂ **high magnetic correlation length** (), while nanocrystalline materials haveÂ **higher anisotropy**Â andÂ **shorter correlation length**Â due to the presence of grain boundaries. Amorphous materials haveÂ **lower saturation magnetization**Â than nanocrystalline materials, but alsoÂ **lower coercivity**Â andÂ **eddy current losses**. Nanocrystalline materials can haveÂ **higher permeability**Â andÂ **Curie temperature**Â than amorphous materials.

		- Fe-Co structural phases
			- Fe-Co alloys can have both the alpha \((\alpha)\) and gamma \((\gamma)\) phases, depending on the temperature and pressure conditions \({ }^1\). The alpha iron \((\alpha-\mathrm{Fe})\) is a body-centered cubic \((\mathrm{BCC})\) structure and is the primary phase of low-carbon or mild steel and most cast irons at room temperature \({ }^1\). Below \(912^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), iron has a \(\mathrm{BCC}\) crystal structure and is known as \(\alpha\)-iron or ferrite.
			  The gamma iron \((\gamma-\mathrm{Fe})\) is a face-centered cubic ( \(\mathrm{FCC})\) structure \({ }^1\). The equilibrium between \(\alpha\) and \(\gamma\) phases can be treated to obtain a good representation of the phase boundaries in the Fe-Co system using the cluster variation method \({ }^2\).
				- [[@Magnetic evidence for structural-phase transformations in Fe-Co alloy nanocrystals produced by a carbon arc]]
			- The \(\alpha\)- and \(\alpha'\)-FeCo phases are structural phases found in Fe-Co alloys, which are known for their high magnetic inductions and Curie temperatures.
			  
			  The \(\alpha\)-FeCo phase is a solid solution based on the body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. This phase can be obtained by mechanical alloying, a process that creates a large number of crystal defects and stacking faults due to the severe plastic deformation that results from the high energy supplied to the system.
			  The \(\alpha'\)-FeCo phase, also known as the B2 structure, is an ordered intermetallic phase. This phase is distinguished from other phases by synchrotron \(x\)-ray diffraction. The \(\alpha'\) phase is formed by the primary crystallization of the amorphous alloy at aboutÂ **500 Â°C**. The formation of this phase contributes to the excellent soft magnetic properties of the alloy, such as high magnetization, low coercivity, and high permeability.

	- Relationship between microstructure and magnetic properties
	  collapsed:: true
		- The magnetic properties of a material are significantly influenced by its microstructure. Here are some key points to consider:
			- **Grain Structure**: The grain structure can greatly affect the magnetic properties. [For instance, a mix of planar, cellular (fine and long), columnar dendritic, and equiaxed dendritic grains can result in different magnetic behaviors](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10854-023-10816-w)[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10854-023-10816-w)[2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-013-0621-4).
			- **Grain Size**: The size of the grains also plays a role. [For example, in FePt storage films used in heat-assisted magnetic recording media, the FePt grains need to be less than 6 nm to achieve 2 Tb/in2 areal density](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/8/12/125018/127705/Microstructure-and-magnetic-properties-of)[3](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/8/12/125018/127705/Microstructure-and-magnetic-properties-of).
			- **Phase Composition**: The phase composition of the material can also influence its magnetic properties. [For instance, a microstructure with homogeneously dispersed Ce2Fe14B and CeFe2 nanocrystals resulted in optimal magnetic properties in one study](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/10/8/869)[4](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/10/8/869).
			- [**Processing Conditions**: The processing conditions used to create the material can affect the resulting microstructure and thus the magnetic properties](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-013-0621-4)[2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-013-0621-4).
			- **Microstructural Features**: Certain microstructural features can enhance or diminish magnetic properties. [For example, complex microstructures generally have higher coercivity and lower remanence](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-021-06458-4)[5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-021-06458-4).
		- In summary, the âbestâ microstructure for magnetic properties can vary depending on the specific requirements of the application. Itâs important to consider factors such as grain structure, grain size, phase composition, processing conditions, and specific microstructural features when optimizing for magnetic properties.
- # Material Characterization Techniques
	- ## Overview of characterization techniques
		- The main methods used to characterize materials for use with WAAM include analyzing the behavior under compressive loads, evaluating surface topography and geometry, examining microstructure and hardness, and assessing internal and external weld irregularities. CT scans can also be used to reveal porosity. These methods help determine the layer geometry, heat input, strain distributions, and integral material properties of WAAM components.

		- The response surface method is a technique used to analyze and optimize the relationship between input factors and a response variable. It involves generating contour plots and 3D surface graphs to visualize the interaction effects of different factors on the response variable. By characterizing the shape of the surface, the optimum point can be located. The method uses a mathematical model, typically a second-order polynomial equation, to represent the response surface. The coefficients of the equation are determined through regression analysis. The technique was used in the study "NdYAG laser micro-welding of ultra-thin FeCo-V magnetic alloy.pdf" to develop a mathematical model for predicting the tensile strength of laser welded joints. The model took into account factors such as welding speed, pulse duration, current, and focal position. The resulting equation was used to optimize the welding parameters for achieving the desired tensile strength.

		- Parameter ramping refers to the adjustment of process parameters, such as current and travel speed, during the deposition of layers in additive manufacturing processes. It is done to optimize the bead geometry and improve the quality of the produced parts. The current and travel speed can be higher at the beginning of the deposition and gradually reduced towards the end to prevent excessive heat sink and inconsistent layer height.

	- ## Techniques for measuring magnetic properties
		- ### Hysteresigraph
		- ### VSM (Vibrating Sample Magnetometer)
		- The main techniques used to measure magnetic properties include the AC method and the VSM (Vibrating Sample Magnetometer) method. The AC method involves measuring AC losses and magnetic properties at a specific frequency using ring samples. The measurements are conducted using a magnetic measure system and the magnetic field strength is calculated using specific equations. The VSM method operates on Faraday's Law of Induction and measures the magnetic behavior of magnetic materials by placing the sample in a constant magnetic field and measuring the induced electric field. The measurements obtained from these techniques include parameters such as saturation magnetization, remanent magnetization, coercivity, and hysteresis curves.

		- A hysteresis loop is a plot of magnetic induction (B) as a function of magnetic field strength (H) for a magnetic material. It shows the relationship between the magnetization of the material and the applied magnetic field. The loop is formed when the magnetic field is increased and then decreased, and it represents the magnetic properties of the material.

For example, an amorphous alloy can transition to a two-phase amorphous-nanocrystalline state upon annealing \({ }^1\). This transition leads to substantial strengthening of the alloys and a partial recovery of their plasticity \({ }^1\). The strengthening at the initial stages of crystallization can be initiated by the difference in the elastic moduli of the amorphous matrix and the precipitated nanocrystals \({ }^1\). So, while these materials start as either amorphous or nanocrystalline, they can develop phases under certain conditions \({ }^1\).

		- [[@Properties of soft magnetic Fe-Co-V alloy produced by laser powder bed fusion]]
			- The paper delves into the impact of heat treatments on the microstructure of the FeCo-V alloy. The heat treatment process is a critical step in optimizing the properties of the alloy, and it significantly influences the microstructure of the material.
			  During heat treatment, the Fe-Co-V alloy is subjected to various temperatures and cooling rates. This process can cause changes in the phase composition and grain structure of the alloy. For instance, it can lead to the formation of different phases such as austenite or martensite, each with its unique set of properties.
			  The paper discusses how different heat treatments can lead to variations in the size, shape, and distribution of these phases within the alloy. These microstructural changes, in turn, affect the magnetic and mechanical properties of the Fe-Co-V alloy.
			  For example, a heat treatment that results in a fine-grained microstructure might enhance the magnetic performance of the alloy. On the other hand, a heat treatment leading to a coarser microstructure could improve its mechanical strength.
			  However, finding the right balance between these properties is a complex task and requires a deep understanding of how heat treatment parameters influence the microstructure evolution. The paper emphasizes that further research is needed in this area to reduce magnetic losses and optimize the performance of Fe-Co-V alloys produced using laser powder bed fusion.

The HT2 heat treatment with low-temperature pre-anneal done prior to the final anneal at 820Â°C for 10 h led to the best magnetic performance and a uniform distribution of relatively large grains. The quasi-static DC measurement results showed that the printed samples have comparable magnetic properties to a commercial Fe-Co-V alloy, indicating potential applications of the material in soft magnetic components. However, the losses were substantial for the printed samples, indicating that further optimization is needed to improve the magnetic properties.

This is a critical finding as it directly influences the weldability of the alloy and can guide future welding procedures to prevent such cracking.
			- Furthermore, the report identifies two primary mechanisms for HAZ cracking: G-phase precipitation and grain boundary softening. These mechanisms are crucial in understanding the behavior of Haynes HR-160 superalloy during welding and can provide valuable insights for future research and practical applications. The studyâs findings offer a deeper understanding of the welding characteristics of this superalloy, particularly concerning HAZ cracking.

			- The paper reports on the Nd:YAG laser micro-welding of ultra-thin \(\mathrm{FeCo}-\mathrm{V}\) magnetic alloy foils and the optimization of weld strength using response surface methodology. The paper investigates the effects of heating on the microstructure, phase, texture and mechanical properties of the weld joints. The paper finds that the fusion zone consists of two different regions: cellular dendritic and equiaxed dendritic structure. The paper also reveals that the previously present \(\gamma\) phase is eliminated from the weld area due to rapid cooling and strain concentration. The paper shows that the tensile strength of the weld joints is influenced by the pulse duration and welding speed, which affect the effective peak power density and the overlapping of successive pulses.

			- This paper discusses the fabrication process and magnetic properties of FeâCo-based crystalline soft magnetic coatings with ultra-high saturation magnetization. The authors used a co-axial powder feeding plasma-transferred arc welding process to fabricate the coatings and optimized the welding parameters to achieve the desired properties. The coatings exhibited excellent soft magnetic properties, making them suitable for various applications in vehicle electrification technologies. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the development of high-performance soft magnetic materials for practical applications.
			- This paper provides a foundation for an investigation into depositing soft magnetic materials using Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) instead of Plasma-Transferred Arc (PTA) welding. The study demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating FeâCo-based crystalline soft magnetic coatings with ultra-high saturation magnetization using PTA welding. The optimized welding parameters and the excellent magnetic properties of the coatings can serve as a reference for developing a similar process using WAAM. However, the differences in the welding process and the microstructure of the deposited material may require adjustments to the welding parameters and post-processing steps. Therefore, further research is needed to investigate the feasibility of depositing soft magnetic materials using WAAM and to optimize the process parameters for achieving the desired magnetic properties.

			- This paper presents a study on the fabrication of \(\mathrm{Fe}\)-Co-based crystalline soft magnetic coatings. These coatings have an ultra-high saturation magnetization (Ms) above 1.9T. This was achieved by using co-axial powder feeding plasma-transferred arc (PTA) welding, with (Fe0.8Co0.2)85B14Si1 alloy as feedstock powders.
			  The study investigates the effects of various welding parameters on the microstructure, hardness, and magnetic properties of the coatings. These parameters include powder feed rate, welding current, and welding speed. The research utilized an orthogonal experiment design and various characterization methods for this investigation.
			  The findings reveal that the coatings have a eutectic-dendrite composite structure. This structure is composed of sorbitic pearlite dendrites and interdendritic (a-Fe?(Fe1\(x\) Cox)2B) eutectics. It was found that the b.c.c. a-Fe solid solution with a higher degree of order and large grain size contributes to the high Ms of the coatings.
			- The paper also highlights that the substrate dilution ratio and the welding heat input significantly influence the coating hardness and coercivity. The optimal coating, which has the lowest coercivity and highest \(\mathrm{Ms}\), is obtained at a powder feed rate of \(24 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{min}\), a welding current of \(118 \mathrm{~A}\), and a welding speed of \(0.13 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{min}\).
		- [[@Additive manufacturing processing and characterization of Fe-Si soft magnetic alloys]]
			- The thesis provides a detailed analysis of the microstructure and magnetic properties of Fe-Si soft magnetic alloys fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). It reveals that these alloys have a strong crystallographic texture and magnetic anisotropy. These properties can be influenced by the scanning strategy and annealing temperature. The study also shows that the silicon content and microstructural design play a significant role in determining the magnetic properties of the alloys. The findings suggest that SLM is a promising technique for producing Fe-Si soft magnetic alloys with high performance and complex geometries for electrical applications.
			- The microstructure and magnetic properties of SLMed Fe-Si alloys can be influenced by the laser energy density, scanning strategy, and annealing temperature. The optimal annealing temperature is found to be 1000 Â°C for 3 h, which can enhance the permeability and reduce the coercivity and power losses of the alloys.
			- The silicon content and microstructural design play a significant role in determining the magnetic properties of the alloys. Increasing Si content can increase the electrical resistivity and reduce the eddy current losses of the alloys, but also decrease the saturation magnetization and increase the brittleness. Designing novel structures such as thin walls and meshes can reduce the total losses and improve the magnetic efficiency of the alloys.
		- [[@Electron Beam Processing of Sensors Relevant Vacoflux-49 Alloy: Experimental Studies of Thermal Zones and Microstructure]]
			- This paper presents experimental studies on the electron beam processing of Vacoflux-49 alloy, a semi-hard magnetic material that is a member of the Fe-Co alloy family. The studies focus on the thermal zones and microstructure of the alloy, and provide valuable insights for researchers and professionals in the field. The article notes that Fe-Co-V alloys, of which Vacoflux-49 is a member, have excellent magnetic properties and are particularly useful for making torque sensors, force sensors, sonar transducers, and the active parts of the rotor of synchronous hysteresis motors. The paper also discusses the challenges and limitations of electron beam processing for Vacoflux-49 alloy, and suggests potential solutions for improving the process. Overall, the paper contributes to the understanding of the properties and applications of Vacoflux-49 alloy, and provides a basis for further research in the field.
			- While the paper focuses on electron beam processing of Vacoflux-49 alloy, it provides valuable insights into the microstructure and thermal zones of the material that could be relevant to an investigation of a similar material, Vacoflux-17, in use with Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM). Both Vacoflux-49 and Vacoflux-17 are semi-hard magnetic materials that belong to the Fe-Co alloy family, and they share some similar properties. Therefore, the experimental findings on the microstructure and thermal zones of Vacoflux-49 could be used as a reference for understanding the behavior of Vacoflux-17 during WAAM. However, it is important to note that the processing conditions and parameters for WAAM are different from those for electron beam processing, and further research would be needed to determine the specific effects of WAAM on the microstructure and properties of Vacoflux-17.
			- The study you provided investigated the microstructural evolution during electron beam melting and welding of Vacoflux-49, a soft magnetic alloy. The conclusions drawn from the study are:
				- The grains in the fusion zone are a mix of planar, cellular (fine and long), columnar dendritic, and equiaxed dendritic. Spikes of long cellular grains start from the fusion front and diminish at the center line.
				- The fusion zone grain structures appear wavy.
				- The end portion of the choked funnel-shaped fusion zone shows a dendritic structure.
				- The shape of the weldment in continuous welding is similar to spot melting and appears like a choked funnel.
				- The grain growth in continuous welding is very similar to that in spot melting. However, the grain structure at the center line in continuous welding is long cellular parallel to the welding direction, while in spot melting it is fine and equiaxed.
		- [[@PTA-Welded Coatings with Saturation Magnetization above 1.3 T Using FeCrBSi Powders with Chemical Composition Similar to AISI 430 Ferrite Stainless Steel]]
			- The authors of the article conducted a study using plasma transferred arc (PTA) welding, depositing FeCrBSi powders on a carbon steel substrate. The composition of these powders was similar to that of AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel (FSS). The aim was to investigate the impact of various welding parameters on the phase composition, microstructure, and particularly the magnetic properties of the coatings.
			- The findings revealed that the coatings had a dendritic structure with a body-centered cubic (b.c.c.) \(\alpha(\mathrm{Fe})\) solid solution as the main phase. Borides and carbides were present as secondary phases. This intricate structure contributed to the unique magnetic properties of the coatings.
			  One of the most remarkable properties observed was the high saturation magnetization (Ms) of the coatings, which exceeded \(1.3 \mathrm{~T}\). This high Ms value indicates that the coatings could generate a strong magnetic field.
			- The relationship between the process parameters, microstructure, and magnetic properties can be summarized as follows:
				- The coating maximum width and welding surplus height increase with the increase of welding heat input and powder distribution density.
				- The coating Ms increases sharply, but its Hc decreases with the increase of substrate dilution ratio.
				- The coating \(\mathrm{Hc}\) increases whereas its Ms decreases with the increase of welding heat input.
				- The coating \(\mathrm{Ms}\) is mainly influenced by the content of b.c.c. \(\alpha(\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Cr})\) solid solution, which depends on the substrate dilution ratio and the \(\mathrm{Cr}\) content in the coating.
				- The coating \(\mathrm{Hc}\) is mainly influenced by the grain size, the volume fraction of non-magnetic or low-Ms inclusions such as borides and carbides, and the residual stress and deformation caused by the rapid solidification.
	- ## How previous work relates to your current project
		- There are several questions relevant for this material characterization which have been partially answered by previous research:
			- How does the microstructure of SMA's change its magnetic properties?
			- How does the heating/phase change of the material affect its microstructure?
			- How do the process parameters in WAAM affect the phase change and otherwise microstructure development of the feedstock?
		- In essence, the planned research will be an empirical attempt to quantify these relationships for Vacoflux-17 and in a more general sense, for Fe-Co broadly speaking.
		- Relating this to Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) of a similar soft magnetic alloy, we can infer that the microstructure and thus the magnetic properties could be influenced by several factors:
			- [**Grain Structure**: Similar to electron beam welding, WAAM could result in a variety of grain structures depending on process parameters](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40430-023-04077-1)[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40430-023-04077-1)[2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-012-1444-6). This could affect the magnetic properties as different grain structures can have different magnetic behaviors.
			- [**Process Parameters**: The selection of WAAM techniques, input parameters, resulting microstructure, post-processing treatments, and defects can influence the final mechanical properties](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40430-023-04077-1)[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40430-023-04077-1).
			- [**Heat Treatment**: Post-deposition heat treatment can help obtain homogeneous characteristics and improve mechanical properties](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40430-023-04077-1)[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40430-023-04077-1). This could potentially enhance the magnetic properties of the alloy.
			- [**Defects**: Defects such as gas pores formed during deposition can affect mechanical properties](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40430-023-04077-1)[2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-012-1444-6), which might indirectly influence the magnetic properties.
	- ## Gaps in the current knowledge based on previous work
		- While several similar materials have been analysed using adjacent AM methods (PTA, LPB-F), no analysis of Fe-Co alloys has been performed with WAAM. The principal differences are the use of wire over powder, and the different heating patterns to be expected from WAAM rather than PTA of LPB-F. In no analyses was a link between process parameters, and thus the different heat input patterns, with the microstructure and thus the magnetic processes performed. Although relationships between the microstructure and magnetic properties have previously been found, only general principles can be extracted rather than specific prescriptions for the yet-undstudied Vacoflux-17.
		- It is still not clear how the heating process affects the composition of soft magnetic alloys post-printing, and specially how the composition would affect magnetic properties.
