- [[Abstract]]
	- A Vaporizing Liquid Micro-thruster using a wavy microchannel design is analyzed with a CFD simulation of the liquid water flow. Gains in the convective performance of the channel when compared to an equivalent straight microchannel are found to be limited at low Reynolds numbers. Pressure losses are found to be negligible. Finally, some considerations on possible future work on this subject are made.
