- [[Abstract]]
	- The main aim of this research is to optimize the tensile strength of laser welded FeCo−V alloy. A mathematical relationship was developed to predict tensile strength of the laser beam welded FeCo−V foils by incorporating process parameters such as lamping current, welding speed, pulse duration and focused position. The procedure was established to improve the weld strength and increase the productivity. The results indicate that the pulse duration and welding speed have the greatest influence on tensile strength. The obtained results showed that the tensile strength of the weld joints increase as a function of increasing pulse duration reaching to a maximum at a pulse duration value of 2.25 ms. Moreover, the tensile strength of joints increases with decrease in welding speed reaching to a maximum at a welding speed of 125 mm/min. It has been shown that increase in pulse duration and decrease in welding speed result in increased effective peak power density and hence formation of more resistant welds. At higher pulse durations and lower welding speeds, the tensile strength of weld joints decreases because of formation of solidification microcracks in the fusion zone.
