		- ### Highlights
			- > This haze inevitably distorts the way we see things and makes us lose our sanity. Nevertheless, sentimentalism is a constant for men, and even when they think they have got it all sorted out, it lives on in strange ways in other places.
			  > 
			  – Yukio Mishima, _The First Sex_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#4f8afe9f-c4bd-4c0a-8935-84da59aaedd9)
			- > The -ism, Akutagawa then argues, is nothing more than a convenience, a trifle, a method for those of below-average intellect to employ in order to give the appearance of eloquence when there is none to be found. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#44a750d0-2ebd-4c98-87d7-cb849446c8e8)
			- > These coddled and indulged moderns represent a truly bizarre combination of overweening self-esteem and fragile self-concept; in a sense, these people have very little sense of self. Their identities invariably revolve around the groups to which they belong – their race, sexuality, etc. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#68f5d59c-dab9-406e-8a17-abea3d6dbdfa)
			- > We have often heard the phrase “the future is female,” but it is unlikely to be exclusively so. While feminine influences may presently hold sway, they will increasingly come to rely on artificial structures for support, such as technology, feminist-influenced institutions like universities, or the administrative state, which refers to the rule-making process carried out by various American federal agencies outside the purview of Congress. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#e72d01c8-a603-4707-af4d-70734b24b19f)
			- > “Men are stronger than women only in terms of strength and intelligence, and men without strength or intelligence are not superior to women in any way. This intelligence, too, was originally developed by men to cover their own emotional weakness and not to be outdone by women,” Yukio Mishima wrote in _The First Sex_. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#cec088a6-79a8-49d6-b16d-8905fdc668fd)
			- > America has abandoned the hero for the superhero. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#724489d6-3605-44e0-96f3-e03182b2eb0c)
			- > But if every death is a tragedy, then, can any death be regarded as a tragedy? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#2602e4d4-2d27-42a1-9eae-44e159b3e4bb)
			- > “There is nothing so painful as able limbs denied motion,” Sōseki Natsume wrote in _The Tower of London_, describing incarceration. “To live is to move. Deprived of activity, one is robbed of the meaning of life, and it is more painful than death to be conscious of such a state. The pain of what one’s lost renders the living lifeless.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#b5210dec-deb2-4d3f-95e5-9393a73d1617)
			- > The group is protected at the expense of the individual. Moreover, the mediocre are valued at the expense of the exceptional. Safety and collectivism are valued over heroism, genius, and individual distinction. In the East, this can be described as an overvaluing of the yin element – favoring the moon at the expense of the sun; favoring the dark and the damp at the expense of the light and the solid. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#b88f52f5-23d7-4b35-a514-f2ba9e062bc8)
			- > One should not aspire to something that is clearly impossible and deliberately designed to be so. Nor do exceptional individuals entertain fantasies about possessing such superhuman abilities. This is the delusion of the mediocre. Rather, exceptional individuals tend to focus on soberly assessing their own potential, honing their skills, and learning from the greatest human exemplars of the past. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#8c4c076c-3ea1-4e84-bd68-734ad67bc4f2)
			- > In the modern American gynocracy, beauty, much like strength, is regarded as a sin. Intelligence, as well, is regarded with suspicion. Literacy is written off as a masculine and “White” value. The culture of America is truly one of emasculation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#53418641-b8f3-45b5-bada-5bc7c762d968)
			- > As Yukio Mishima wrote, observing gangsters, one often finds that the bosses are typically diminutive individuals with lackluster appearances, while the towering figures of six feet are regarded as mere subordinates, petty thugs. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#c06bacdf-b12e-4e45-86fa-fd2e91cca818)
			- > True masculinity lies in being attentive and perceptive to every detail while distinguishing between the significant and the insignificant, avoiding fixation on trivialities. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#748eb7de-60a3-4b88-8d0d-e0cd557366ce)
			- > there are many instances where men possessing masculine looks and physiques find themselves in the kitchen making omelettes, monitoring the prices of rice in household account books, playfully teasing their wives over trivial matters, or happily tending to household chores. Appearances can indeed be deceiving. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#ef71f047-a8cf-45cf-998b-31974597366f)
			- > True masculinity lies in being attentive and perceptive to every detail while distinguishing between the significant and the insignificant, avoiding fixation on trivialities. Masculinity can be regarded as synonymous with “objectivity” or “objective judgment.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#2b8f10cd-8015-40b8-89a2-bcdd75293835)
			- > A man who acts incessantly without much thought often possesses a sentimental nature, even more so than a schoolgirl lost in reverie. Sentimentalism, therefore, does not encompass the essence of masculinity. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#c1b19fd1-036a-40b1-a7f9-7a31691eaae1)

			- > Due to the influence of American culture, ideals of manhood and the perception of women as sexual objects have gradually converged. As a result, the term “masculinity” has transformed to denote something akin to “rugged sexual attractiveness.” However, in Japan, “masculinity” retains a somewhat unsexual, sublime quality. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#9a09d653-9772-479f-9408-cc40af197a86)

			- > As Mishima wrote, the fiercely delicate, sword-wielding, moon-gazing “manly” man should commute on crowded trains to his modestly paid job each morning, often unnoticed by women. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#d53234f3-c0e4-49e8-8d70-cecaba38015b)

			- > “If a boy becomes belligerent, buy him a bamboo sword and let him practice kendo, and he will be dissipated. A peace-loving man is a castrated man.” No doubt, Mishima anticipated the _sōshoku-kei danshi_, and its American equivalent, the locavore. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#7aa0f115-5f10-4f7b-a995-dede01eee924)
			- > However, it is also possible that he is chasing a “dream that only men can understand,” profound and poignant thoughts that women cannot understand. At that moment, he is not just an ordinary 100-yen man, but a man among men, a great man.
			  > 
			  But the man, without explaining much of anything, just kind of goes on and on.
			  > 
			  ‘Umm, just a moment ……’
			  > 
			  And,
			  > 
			  ‘No, a ……’
			  > 
			  He vaguely lies about it, and when he reaches the point of urgency, she says, ‘Idiot. I remembered your lovely demeanor when we were engaged.’
			  > 
			  The woman continues to say the most absurd things, such as, ‘Oh, really? You’re an idiot.’
			  > 
			  The young wife is satisfied. But then she doesn’t realize she’s let a very important man slip away. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-16-heroic-masculinity-part-two-1896a40c29c#ece142da-a564-4fb6-8301-fcb970075990)
