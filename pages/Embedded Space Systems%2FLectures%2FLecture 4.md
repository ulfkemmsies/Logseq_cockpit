	- Software scheduling of CPU time
		- Dynamic priority
			- It allows schedule to be computed on-the-fly
				- Based on importance
				- Prioritization means that less important tasks don't delay more important ones
			- How often do we decide what to run?
				- Coarse grain: After a task finishes. Also called Run-to-Completion (RTC) or non-preemptive dynamic scheduling.
					- Scheduler chooses among Ready tasks for execution based on priority
					- Scheduling Rules
						- If no task is running, scheduler starts the highest priority ready task
						- Once started, a task runs until it completes
						- Tasks then enter waiting state until triggered or released again
				- Fine grain: Any time. Called Preemptive, since one task can preempt another.
					- Advantages
						- Preemption offers best response time
						- It allows to do more processing (support more potholes, or higher vehicle speed)
					- Disadvantages
						- Requires more complicated programming, more memory
						- Introduces vulnerability to data race conditions

			- Advantage:
				- Very simple
			- Disadvantages:

	- Approaches to Testing
		- Incremental Testing
			- Code a function and then test it (module/unit/element testing)
			- Test then a few working functions together (integration testing)
				- Continue enlarging the scope of tests as you write new functions
			- Incremental testing requires extra code for the test harness
