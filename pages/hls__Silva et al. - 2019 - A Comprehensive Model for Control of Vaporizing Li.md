- s the mass flow rates considered are in terms of milligrams per second, we assume that the changes in the mass of propellant do not influence the spacecraft dynamics

- In order to model this dynamics we divided the model of the microthruster into four parts: the nozzle model that provides the mass flow rate  ̇m3 based on the pressure in the chamber, the vaporization model which calculates the volumetric fraction of vapor inside the chamber, the pressure model that calculates the pressure inside the chamber based on the density of the vapor part, and the temperature model that relates the thruster temperature to the applied power.

- ) Nozzle model: To model the mass flow rate at the nozzle ̇m3, the ideal rocket conditions are assumed [9, p. 46]. In reality, the following assumptions of the ideal rocket theory do not apply to the microthruster considered in this paper:• adiabatic flow: the flow is not adiabatic since the nozzle is heated up together with the complete thruster, therefore there is heat transfer from the nozzle to the gas.• negligible friction: the friction and boundary layer effects are not negligible due to the size of the thruster.• uniform distribution: the gas velocity, pressure, temperature, and density are not uniform across any section normal to the nozzle axis due to friction and boundary layer effects. Nonetheless, we assume that the changes generated by these effects can be neglected in order to simplify the modeling. Then the mass flow going through the nozzle is given by (3). The second and third assumptions might be compensated by multiplying the mass flow rate by a discharge coefficient which can be experimentally measured for the specific device [11].

- T = B A − log10 p + C (11) where A = 10.27, B = 1810.94, and C = 28.67 for pressure in Pa and temperature in the range 372.15–647.15 K.

- If we consider the pressure in the range 1–5 bar, then we can replace the term p1√T1 in (3) with a function of the pressure: p1√T1= p1( B A−log10 p1 + C≈ α1p1 + β1 (12) where α1 and β1 are the coefficients of the first order Taylor series expansion and are functions of the parameters used in(11) and the linearization point ps:

- Then, the average volume of vapor Vav is written as a function of the temperature of the thruster and the pressure: Vav = aT Tn + app1 + b (16) where aT , ap, and b are the parameters of the linear regression and Tn is the temperature of the chip measured around the nozzle.

- For the analysis presented here, the coefficients have been estimated as: aT = 1.63 × 10−11 m3 K−1, ap =−7.45 × 10−15 m3 Pa−1, and b = −4.36 × 10−10 m3.

- In order to complete the model, we need an expression for the time derivative of the volume which in this analysis has been assumed to be a first-order linear system of the form: ̇V = A (Vav − V )

- Considering the ideal gas law given by: p T V = mRs (19) where m is the mass of gas. Following a similar approach as the linear approximation used in the nozzle model, we can approximate the term p T by a linear relation reducing the equation to: p = 1α2( mRs V − β2)(20) where:α2 = C log10(ps)2 − (2 A C + B) log10(ps) + A(A C + B) − B ln(10)(B − C log10(ps) + A C)2(21)β2 = ps( C + B(A−log10 (ps ))− α2 ps (22)

- The temperature of the thruster is modeled as a linear first-order system whose input is the applied power. The Laplace transfer function of the powertemperature system is given by (23): T (s) P (s) = K s + 1τ(23) where τ = 119.5 s and K = 28.5 K W−1 s−1 have been experimentally estimated using data of power and temperature.

- change in resistance due to changes in the temperature is described by the following equation [12]: R = αR0 (T − T0) + R0 (24) where R is the resistance, T is the current temperature, and R0 is the resistance measured at temperature T0. The value of α has been experimentally characterized for many devices and on average is α = 1.09 × 10−3 K−1 [8].
