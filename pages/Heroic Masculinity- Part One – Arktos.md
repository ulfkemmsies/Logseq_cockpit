			- > Sitcoms and films typically feature the archetypes of a bumbling, incompetent husband, fat and guzzling beer, and his long-suffering wife, who saves him from whatever mishap he has gotten himself into.

			- > The only thing wrong with men in the world is that they try to make women see their heroism.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-arktos-com-2023-07-15-heroic-masculinity-part-one-1896a408ae9#29a9a161-4d57-4558-8d66-6ba1ce43e73a)
			- > These feminists advocate narratives that explore “complex” characters – that is, characters who reflect their own experiences, preferences, and perspectives.
