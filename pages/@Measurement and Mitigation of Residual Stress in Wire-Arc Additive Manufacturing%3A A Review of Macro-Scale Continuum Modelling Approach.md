- [[Abstract]]
	- Wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has recently attracted researchers to produce metal components with a highdeposition rate. Many researchers are trying to establish the WAAM process as a high-deposition metal additive manufacturing (AM) process. A computationally efficient mathematical model used for the metal-AM process yields a framework for component qualification as per international standards. Since heat transaction in the AM process can control the thermal-field generated through continuous heat deposition. Therefore, the present study focuses on the critical review of multi-physics continuum modelling of WAAM at a macro-scale level. Thermo-mechanical model for WAAM has been discussed extensively, i.e., heat-source models, materials models, meshing strategy, and boundary conditions. Further, a review of the simulation results discussed as thermal fields, residual stress and distortion, and experimental validation to provide a critique of reallife experiments. Also, various residual stress/distortion mitigation techniques used in the WAAM have been compiled to provide a framework for future directions.
